# How to Configure the Security Settings in Thunderbird

## About the Security Options in Thunderbird

In the context of **Mozilla Thunderbird**, security generally refers to protecting your computer from harmful or malicious email messages. Some may be just spam, others may contain spyware and viruses. There are several settings which must be configured, disabled or enabled within **Mozilla Thunderbird** to strengthen its ability to defend your system from attacks originating from emails. It is also *absolutely crucial* that you have anti-malware and firewall software installed.

For more information on preventing harmful or malicious software, please refer to the **How-to Booklet** chapter [1. Protecting your Computer from Viruses, Malware and Hackers](https://securityinabox.org/chapter-1) for more information about tools such as [Avast](https://securityinabox.org/en/avast_main), [Comodo Firewall](https://securityinabox.org/en/comodofirewall_main) and [Spybot](https://securityinabox.org/en/spybot_main).

## How to Disable the Preview Pane in Thunderbird

The **Thunderbird** main window is divided into three areas: The left sidebar displays the folders for your email accounts, the right side shows a list of messages, and the bottom pane displays a *preview* of a selected email message. The preview is automatically visible as soon as a message has been selected.

**Note**: If an email contains any malicious code, then *preview* message pane could activate it; therefore it is a good idea to disable it.

*Figure 1: The Thunderbird main user interface*

To disable the preview pane, perform the following step:

#### Step 1
**Click** ![menu](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/24a.png) to display the *Thunderbird Menu* and **select Options > Layout > Massage Pane F8** to disable it as follows:

![Options menu displaying Layout sub-menu and Message Pane option deselected](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/24.png)

*Figure 2: The Options menu displaying the Layout sub-menu and Message Pane option deselected*

The *Message Pane* will disappear, and you must **double-click** an email message to read its contents. If an email message looks suspicious (perhaps it has an unexpected or irrelevant subject title, or comes from an unknown sender), you now can choose to delete it without having to preview its content.

## How to Disable the HTML Feature in Thunderbird

**Thunderbird** lets you use **HyperText Markup Language** (**HTML**) to compose and read messages. This lets you receive and send messages that include colours, fonts, images and other formatting features. However, **HTML** is the same language used for Web pages; viewing messages with **HTML** formatting, may expose you to malicious emails which pose some of the same kinds of threats posed by web pages.

To disable the **HTML** formatting feature, perform the following step:

#### Step 1

**Click** ![menu](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/24a.png) to display the *Thunderbird Menu* and **select Options> View > Message Body As > Plain Text** as follows:

![View menu displaying Message Body submenu with Plain Text option selected](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/25.png)

*Figure 3: The View menu displaying the Message Body submenu with the Plain Text option selected*

## How to Configure the Security Options

**Thunderbird** has two built-in junk mail filters that can help you determine which of your incoming messages are spam. By default, these filters are disabled, so you must enable them for use. Even after they have been enabled, you will continue to receive junk mail, but **Thunderbird** will automatically sort them into the *Junk* folder.

Email scams - also referred to as *phishing* emails - usually attempt to make you click on a link that is embedded in the email. Frequently, these links direct your browser to a web site that will attempt to infect your computer with a virus. In other cases, the link will take you to a web site that appears to be legitimate, to deceive you into entering a valid user name and password, which can then be used or sold by the entity or people for commercial or malicious purposes.

**Thunderbird** can help to identify and warn you about emails like this. Additional tools that can help prevent infection from malicious websites are described in the [Other Useful Mozilla Add-Ons](https://securityinabox.org/en/firefox_others) section of the **Firefox** chapter.

The first set of assorted junk mail and security controls are accessed through the *Options - Security* window through which the majority of these privacy and security options are configured. To access them, perform the following steps:

#### Step 1


**Select Menu > Options** to activate the *Options* window.

#### Step 2

**Click** ![Security](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/26.png) to activate the following screen:

![Security window displaying its associated tabs](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/27.png)

*Figure 4: The Security window displaying its associated tabs*

### The Junk tab

#### Step 1

**Check** the relevant options in the *Junk* tab as shown in *figure 4* above, to enable **Thunderbird** to delete email that you have determined to be junk mail. Additional junk mail settings are described later on in this section.

### The Email Scams tab

#### Step 1

**Check** the *Tell me if the message I'm reading is a suspected email scam* option to enable **Thunderbird** to analyse messages for email scams as follows:

![Email Scams tab](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/28.png)

*Figure 5: The Email Scams tab*

### The Anti-Virus tab

#### Step 1

**Click** the *Anti-Virus* tab to activate the following screen:

![Anti-Virus tab](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/29.png)

*Figure 6: The Anti-Virus tab*

This option lets your anti-virus software scan and isolate individual messages as they arrive. Without this setting enabled, it is possible that your *entire* Inbox folder could be 'quarantined' if you receive an infected message.

**Note**: This assumes that you have a functioning anti-virus program installed. Please refer to [Avast](https://securityinabox.org/en/avast_main) for more information on how to install and configure anti-virus software.

### The Passwords tab

#### Step 2

**Click** the *Passwords* tab to activate the following screen:

![Passwords tab](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/30.png)

*Figure 7: The Passwords tab*

**Important**: We strongly recommend to keep your passwords private and secure using a software designed precisely for this purpose; please refer to [KeyPass](https://securityinabox.org/en/keepass_main) for more information.

**Note**: The options in the Password tab will only work if you checked the *Remember password* option in the first *Mail Account Setup* screen when you registered your email accounts with **Thunderbird**.

#### Step 1

**Click** ![Saved Passwords](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/31.png) to activate the following screen:

![Saved Passwords window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/32.png)

*Figure 8: The Saved Passwords window*

The *Saved Passwords* window lets you remove or view all the corresponding passwords for each of your accounts. However, to maximise your privacy and security, you can set a *Master Password* to protect access to your email accounts and make all of your account passwords inaccessible to anyone else familiar with the **Thunderbird** password options.

#### Step 3

**Check** the *Use a master password* option as shown in *figure 7* to enable the *Change Master Password...* button.

#### Step 4

Click [Change Master Password](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/33.png) to activate the following screen:

![Change Master Password window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/34.png)

*Figure 9: Change Master Password window*

#### Step 5

**Type** in an appropriately strong password that only you will remember, and then **click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/35.png) to confirm it as your *Master Password*.

### Web Content

A cookie is a small piece of text which your web browser uses to authenticate or identify a given web site. The *Web Content* option lets you specify which blog, news feed or newsgroup cookies are reliable and safe.

#### Step 1

**Click** ![Privacy](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/36.png) to display the *Web Content* options as follows:

![Privacy tab](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/37.png)

*Figure 10: The Privacy tab*

#### Step 2

**Select** the *I close Thunderbird* item in the *Keep until*: option to delete those cookies whenever you close **Thunderbird** for additional security.

## How to Enable the Account Settings Junk Mail Filter

The second type of **Thunderbird** junk mail filter is available through the *Account Settings - Junks Settings* window. By default, these filters are disabled, so they must be enabled if you wish to use them. Whenever junk emails arrive **Thunderbird** will automatically sort them into the *Junk* folders associated with different accounts.

#### Step 1

**Select Tools > Account Settings** to activate the *Account Settings* window.

#### Step 2

**Select** the *Junk Settings* option associated with a specific **Gmail** or **RiseUp** account in the sidebar.

#### Step 3

**Enable** the *Junk Settings* options so that your own *Account Settings - Junk Settings* screen resembles the following:

![Account Settings - Junk Settings window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/38.png)

*Figure 11: The Account Settings - Junk Settings window*

#### Step 4

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/35.png) to complete the configuration of the *Account Settings* window.

**Note**: The *Junk Settings* options must be configured separately for each account. As such, junk mail for a **Gmail** or a **RiseUp** account will be placed in its corresponding *Deleted* folder. Alternatively, you may designate a *Local Folder* to receive junk mail from all your accounts.

*Figure 12: The Account Settings - Junk Settings window, displaying the settings for a central junk folder*

#### Step 1

**Select** the *Junk Settings* option directly beneath *Local Folders* in the sidebar.

#### Step 2

**Select** the *Local Folders* item from the *"Junk" folder on*: drop-down list as displayed in *figure 13*.

#### Step 3

*Click* ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/thunderbird-en-1/35.png) to complete the configuration of the *Account Settings* window.

Now that you have successfully configured the assorted security options and junk mail settings in **Thunderbird**, please proceed to the following section, [How to Use Enigmail with GnuPG in Thunderbird](https://securityinabox.org/en/thuderbird_encryption).
