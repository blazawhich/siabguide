Title: Introduction

**Mozilla Thunderbird** is a free and open source email client for receiving, sending and storing emails. You can manage multiple email accounts through a single program. **Enigmail** and **GnuPG** will give you access to authentication, digital signing and encryption to ensure the privacy and security of your email communication.

The **Mozilla Thunderbird** email client is available for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS**, **Microsoft Windows** and other operating systems. Managing multiple email accounts is a complex task from the digital security viewpoint; therefore, we *strongly recommend* that you use **Mozilla Thunderbird** for this purpose. The security advantages available in **Thunderbird**, a cross-platform *free* and *open source* program, are even more important when compared to its commercial equivalents like **Microsoft Outlook**. However, if you would prefer to use a program other than **Mozilla Thunderbird**, we recommend the following free and open source alternatives:

  * **Claws Mail** available for **GNU Linux** and **Microsoft Windows**;
  * **Sylpheed** available for for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS** and **Microsoft Windows**;
  * **Alpine** available for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS** and **Microsoft Windows**.

Note: Although we recommend using **Enigmail/GnuPG** for its ease of use with Thunderbird, you still can also use stand-alone encryption tools such as gpg4usb in conjunction with Thunderbird. Please read [gpg4usb](https://securityinabox.org/en/gpg4usb_portable "gpg4usb") chapter to see other way to encrypt your email using public key encryption method.
