# Things you should know about this tool before you start

**Mozilla Thunderbird** is a cross-platform, free and open source email client for receiving, sending and storing emails. An email client is a computer application that lets you download and manage your email messages without an Internet browser. You can manage multiple email accounts using a single program. You must have an existing email account before using **Thunderbird**. You may also create **RiseUp** email accounts if you wish.

**Enigmail** is an add-on developed for **Thunderbird**. It lets users access the authentication and encryption features provided by **GNU Privacy Guard** (**GnuPG**).

**GnuPG** is a public key encryption program used to generate and manage the key pairs to be used in encrypting and decrypting messages, to keep your email communications private and secure. **GnuPG** must be installed for **Enigmail** to work, as will be described later in this chapter.
