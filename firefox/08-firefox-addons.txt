# The NoScript Add-On

![NoScript](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/noscript_logo.png)

**NoScript** is a particularly useful **Mozilla Add-on** that can help protect your computer from malicious websites on the Internet. It operates by implementing a 'white list' of sites that you have determined as acceptable, safe or trusted (like a home-banking site or an on-line journal). All other sites are considered potentially harmful and their functioning is restricted, until you have determined that the content of a particular site presents no harm; at this point, you may add it to the white list. 

**NoScript** will automatically start blocking all banners, pop-up advertisements, **JavaScript** and **Java** code, as well as other potentially harmful web site attributes. **NoScript** cannot differentiate between harmful content and content necessary to correctly display a web site. It is up to you to make exceptions for those sites with content that you think is safe.

## Use the NoScript Add-On

Before you begin using **NoScript** ensure that it was successfully installed by **selecting Tools > Add-ons** to activate the *Add-ons* window and confirm that it has been installed.

**Tip**: Although **NoScript** might seem a little frustrating at first (as the websites you have always visited may not display properly), you will immediately profit from the automated object-blocking feature. This will restrict pesky advertisements, pop-up messages and malicious code built (or hacked) into web pages.  

**NoScript** will run silently in the background until it detects the presence of **JavaScript**, **Adobe Flash** or other script-like content. At that point **NoScript** will block this content and status bar will appear on the bottom of the **Firefox** window as follows: 

![NoScript status bar](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-50.png)

*Figure 1: The NoScript status bar*

The **NoScript** status bar displays information about which *objects* (for example, advertisements and pop-up messages) and *scripts* are currently prevented from executing themselves on your system. The following two figures are prime examples of **NoScript** at work: In *Figure 2*, **NoScript** has successfully blocked an advertisement created in **Adobe Flash Player** on a commercial website. 

![NoScript blocking pop-up advertisement](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-51.png)

*Figure 2: An example of NoScript blocking a pop-up advertisement in a commercial site*

In *Figure 3*, the **Twitter** web site notifies you that **JavaScript** must be enabled (at least temporarily) to view this web site. 

![Twitter web site requesting that JavaScript be enabled](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-52.png)

*Figure 3: The Twitter web site requesting that JavaScript be enabled*

Since **NoScript** does not differentiate between malicious and real code, certain key features and functions (for instance, a tool bar) may be missing. Some web pages present content, including script-like content, from more than one website. For example, a website like **www.twitter.com** has two sources of scripts (*twitter.com* and *twimg.com*): 

![NoScript status bar Options](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-53.png)

*Figure 4: An example of the NoScript status bar Options menu*

To unblock scripts in these circumstances, start by **selecting** the *Temporarily Allow [website name]* option (in this instance, *Temporarily allow twitter.com*). However, if this does not allow you to view the page you may determine, through a process of trial and error, the minimum number of websites required to view your chosen content. For instance, on **Twitter**, you must **select** the *Temporarily allow twitter.com* and *Temporarily allow twimg.com* options, in order for **Twitter** to work.

**Warning**! Under **no** circumstances should you ever select the *Allow Scripts Globally (dangerous)* option. As far as possible, avoid selecting the *Allow all from this page* option. Occasionally, you may have to permit all scripts; in this situation, ensure that you only do this temporarily for sites you really trust, that is, until the end of your on-line session. It only takes a *single* injection of malicious code to compromise your on-line privacy and safety. 

For websites that you trust and frequently visit, **select** the *Allow [website name]* option. (In the example above, *Allow twitter.com* and *Allow twimg.com* have been selected). Selecting this option permits **NoScript** to permanently list that website as trusted.

# Useful Firefox Add-Ons

The **Mozilla Firefox Add-ons** featured in this section are designed to enhance or protect the anonymity, privacy and security of your browsing sessions. To download them, please refer to the [**Downloading Firefox**](/en/firefox_main) section.

## HTTPS Everywhere

![HTTPS Everywhere](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-101.png)

**HTTPS Everywhere** is a **Mozilla Firefox** extension ensuring that you always communicate with specified list of websites over an encrypted (*https*) channel. Although many websites do offer encryption, they tend default to an unencrypted http address. The **HTTPS Everywhere** extension fixes these problems by rewriting all your requests to these sites to the **HTTPS** protocol. It runs silently in the background, ensuring that your Internet sessions with those selected sites are safe and secure. However, it works *only* when those sites are using the **HTTPS** protocol themselves.

After the **HTTPS Everywhere** extension has been successfully installed, the following screen will appear:

![Should HTTPS Everywhere Use the SSL Observatory?](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-75.png)

*Figure 1: The Should HTTPS Everywhere Use the SSL Observatory? prompt screen* 

#### Step 1

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-76.png) to activate the following screen: 

![SSL Observatory Preferences](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-77.png)

*Figure 2: The SSL Observatory Preferences screen* 

**Note**: If there has been a previous installation of **HTTPS Everywhere** on your **Firefox** browser, **select Tools > HTTPS Everywhere > SSL Observatory Preferences** and verify that the *Use the Observatory* and *When you see a new certificate, tell the Observatory which ISP you are connected to* options are enabled. If you are not using **Tor**, **enable** the *Check certificates even if Tor is not available* option as well.

## Adblock Plus

![Adblock Plus](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-102.png)

**Adblock Plus** is a content filtering extension designed to limit or restrict the ability of ads to display themselves. 

After **Adblock Plus** has been successfully installed, the following page will be launched: 
[**chrome://adblockplus/content/ui/firstRun.html**](chrome://adblockplus/content/ui/firstRun.html)
 
![Adblock Plus chrome content](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-60.png)

*Figure 3: The Adblock Plus chrome content page*

#### Step 1

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-61.png) so that it changes to ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-62.png) for the *Malware Blocking*, *Remove Social Media Buttons* and *Disable Tracking* options (as shown in *Figure 1* above).

#### Step 2

**Select Tools > Adblock Plus > Filter preferences...** to activate the following window:

![Add Adblock Plus Filter Preferences with 3 filter subscriptions](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-63.png)

*Figure 4: The Add Adblock Plus Filter Preferences displaying three filter subscriptions*

#### Step 2

**Click** each filter subscription checkbox to enable it (as shown in *Figure 2* above), and then **disable** the ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-64.png) option, to prevent *all* advertisements described or listed in these filters from displaying themselves.

#### Step 3

If you work in multiple languages, **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-65.png) to view different filter subscriptions, then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-66.png) to activate a drop-down list of different subscription filters, **select** the appropriate one, and then **click**  ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-67.png).

#### Step 4

To update your filter subscriptions, **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-68.png), and then **select** the *Update filters* item from the pop-up menu.
