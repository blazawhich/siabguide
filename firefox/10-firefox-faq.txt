***Q***: Why would I want so many different add-ons to defend myself against malicious websites? If **NoScript** protects me from potentially dangerous scripts, for example, why do I also need other add-ons which function in a similar way?

***A***: It is often a good idea to use more than one tool to address the same general security issue. (Anti-virus programs are an important exception to this rule, since they tend to conflict with one another.) These **Firefox** add-ons use very different techniques to protect your browser from a variety of threats. **NoScript**, for example, blocks all scripts from unknown websites, but users tend to 'whitelist' the websites they visit frequently, which allows them to load potentially-malicious scripts. **NoScript** users also tend to allow unknown sites to load scripts, on a temporary basis, if those scripts are necessary for the page to function properly.
