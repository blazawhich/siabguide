Title: Description
Language: EN


In general, when you want to protect something, you lock it up with a key. Houses, cars and bicycle locks all have physical keys; protected files have encryption keys; bank cards have PIN numbers; and email accounts have passwords. All of these keys, physical and electronic, have one thing in common: they open their respective locks just as effectively in the hands of somebody else. You can install advanced firewalls, secure email accounts, and encrypted disks, but if your password is weak, or if you allow it to fall into the wrong hands, they will not do you much good.
