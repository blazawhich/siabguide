# Protect your device from malware and hackers

Regardless of your broader objectives, keeping your device healthy is a critical first step down the path toward better security. So, before you begin worrying too much about strong passwords, private communication and secure deletion, for example, you need to make sure that your computer is not vulnerable to [*hackers*](/en/glossary#Hacker) or plagued by malicious software, often called [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware), such as viruses and spyware. Otherwise, it is impossible to guarantee the effectiveness of any other security precautions you might take. After all, there is no in point locking your door if the burglar is already downstairs, and it doesn't do you much good to search downstairs if you leave the door wide open. Accordingly, this chapter explains how to maintain your software and use tools like [*Avast*](/en/glossary#Avast), [*Spybot*](/en/glossary#Spybot) and [*Comodo Firewall*](/en/glossary#Comodo_Firewall) to protect your computer against the ever-present dangers of [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware) infection and [*hacker*](/en/glossary#Hacker) attacks. Although the tools recommended in this chapter are for Windows, which is the operating system most vulnerable to these threats, [*GNU/Linux*](/en/glossary#GNU_Linux) and Apple OS X users are also at risk and should still adopt the tactics presented below.
