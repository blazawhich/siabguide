# Viruses

There are many different ways to classify viruses, and each of these methods comes with its own set of colorfully-named categories. Worms, macroviruses, trojans and backdoors are some of the more well-known examples. Many of these viruses spread over the Internet, using email, malicious webpages or other means to infect unprotected computers. Others spread through removable media, particularly devices like USB memory sticks and external hard drives that allow users to write information as well as reading it. Viruses can destroy, damage or infect the information in your computer, including data on external drives. They can also take control of your computer and use it to attack other computers. Fortunately there are many anti-virus tools that you can use to protect yourself and those with whom you exchange digital information.

# Spyware

Spyware is a class of malicious software that can track the work you do, both on your computer and on the Internet, and send information about it to someone who shouldn't have access to it. These programs can record the words you type on your keyboard, the movements of your mouse, the pages you visit and the programs you run, among other things. As a result, they can undermine your computer's security and reveal confidential information about you, your activities and your contacts. Computers become infected with spyware in much the same way that they contract viruses, so many of the suggestions above are also helpful when defending against this second class of [*malware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Malware). Because malicious webpages are a major source of spyware infection, you should pay extra attention to the websites you visit and make sure that your browser settings are secure.
