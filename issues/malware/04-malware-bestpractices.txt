# Keeping your software up-to-date

Computer programs are often large and complex. It is inevitable that some of the software you use on a regular basis contains undiscovered errors, and it is likely that some of these errors could undermine your computer's security. Software developers continue to find these errors, however, and release updates to fix them. **It is therefore essential that you frequently update all of the software on your computer, including the operating system**. If Windows is not updating itself automatically, you can configure it to do so by clicking the **Start** menu, selecting **All Programs** and clicking **Windows Update**. This will open Internet Explorer, and take you to the Microsoft Update page, where you can enable the **Automatic Updates** feature. See the [**Further reading**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/chapter_1_5) section to learn more about this.

Similarly it is important to make sure that all of the other software installed on your computer is updated. In order to do it you first need to know what programs you have on your computer and perhaps uninstall those that are not essential (on Windows go to Control Panel and *Programs* or *Add/Remove Programs*). Then it is good to review for each program if it is the latest version, how can it be updated and will it update itself automatically in the future.

## Staying up-to-date with freeware and FOSS (free and open source software) tools

[*Proprietary*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Proprietary_software) software often requires proof that it was purchased legally before it will allow you to install updates. If you are using a pirated copy of Microsoft Windows, for example, it may be unable to update itself, which would leave you and your information extremely vulnerable. By not having a valid license, you put yourself and others at risk. Relying on illegal software can present non-technical risks, as well. The authorities in a growing number of countries have begun to verify that organisations possess a valid license for each piece of software that they use. Police have confiscated computers and closed down organizations on the basis of 'software piracy.' This justification can be abused quite easily in countries where the authorities have political reasons to interfere with a given organisation's work. Fortunately, you do not have to purchase expensive software to protect yourself from tactics like this.

We strongly recommend that you try out the [*freeware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Freeware) or [*FOSS*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#FOSS) (free and open source software) alternatives to any [*propriety software*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Proprietary_software) that you currently use, especially those programs that are unlicensed. [*Freeware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Freeware) and [*FOSS*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#FOSS) tools are often written by volunteers and non-profit organisations who release them, and even update them, free of charge. [*FOSS*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#FOSS) tools, in particular, are generally considered to be more secure than [*proprietary*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Proprietary_software) ones, because they are developed in a transparent way that allows their [*source code*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Source_code) to be examined by a diverse group of experts, any one of whom can identify problems and contribute solutions.

Many [*FOSS*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#FOSS) applications look like, and work almost the same way as, the proprietary software that they were written to replace. At the same time, you can use these programs alongside proprietary software, including the Windows operating system, without any problems. Even if your colleagues continue to use the commercial version of a particular type of program, you can still exchange files and share information with them quite easily. In particular, you might consider replacing Internet Explorer, Outlook or Outlook Express and Microsoft Office with Firefox, Thunderbird and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), respectively.

In fact, you could even move away from the Microsoft Windows operating system entirely, and try using a more secure [*FOSS*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#FOSS) alternative called [*GNU/Linux*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#GNU_Linux). The best way to find out if you're ready to make the switch is simply to give it a try. You can download a [*LiveCD*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#LiveCD) version of [*Ubuntu Linux*](http://www.ubuntu.com/), burn it to a CD or DVD, put it in your computer and restart. When it's done loading, your computer will be running [*GNU/Linux*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#GNU_Linux), and you can decide what you think. Don't worry, none of this is permanent. When you're finished, simply shut down your computer and remove the Ubuntu [*LiveCD*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#LiveCD). The next time you start up, you'll be back in Windows, and all of you applications, settings and data will be just as you left them. In addition to the general security advantages of open-source software, Ubuntu has a free, easy-to-use update tool that will keep your operating system and much of your other software from becoming outdated and insecure.
