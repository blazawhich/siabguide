# Encrypting your information

[*Encrypting*](/en/glossary#Encryption) your information is a bit like keeping it in a locked safe. Only those who have a key or know the lock's combination (an [*encryption*](/en/glossary#Encryption) key or password, in this case) can access it. The analogy is particularly appropriate for [*TrueCrypt*](/en/glossary#TrueCrypt) and tools like it, which create secure containers called 'encrypted volumes' rather than simply protecting one file at a time. You can put a large number of files into an [*encrypted*](/en/glossary#Encryption) volume, but these tools will not protect anything that is stored elsewhere on your computer or USB memory stick.

While other software can provide similar strength *[encryption](/en/glossary#Encryption)*, [*TrueCrypt*](/en/glossary#TrueCrypt) contains several important features to allow you to design your information security strategy. It offers the possibility of permanently **encrypting the whole disk of your computer** including all your files, all temporary files created during your work, all programs you have installed and all Windows operating system files. TrueCrypt supports *[encrypted](/en/glossary#Encryption)* volumes on portable storage devices. It provides 'deniability' features described in the [***Hiding your sensitive information***](/en/chapter_4_2) section below. In addition TrueCrypt is a [*free and open source*](/en/glossary#FOSS) program.
