Q: Am I going to have to spend all my time typing passwords into TrueCrypt?

A: No, you only need to type the password in once, when you're opening the Standard Volume. When you've done that, you can open any file in it without putting in the password each time.

Q: Can I easily uninstall TrueCrypt if I don't want it any more? If I do, will my files remain encrypted?

A: Yes, TrueCrypt can be easily removed by selecting Start > All Programs > Truecrypt > Uninstall Truecrypt. You can later install TrueCrypt again to access files in any volume you created. If you transfer the volume to another computer, you will still need your password and the TrueCrypt program to access it.

Q: Will different versions of Windows bring up different screens when we try to load and use TrueCrypt?

A: Their appearance may be slightly different, but the content will remain the same.

Q: What kinds of information require encryption?

A: Ideally, you should encrypt all your documents, pictures and any other files that contain private and sensitive information. Should you lose your computer, or if it is confiscated, the information within your TrueCrypt volume will remain secure.

Q: How secure will our files be?

A: TrueCrypt has been independently tested and reviewed by security experts to see how well it performs and whether it performs all the functions it claims to. Overall results show that TrueCrypt offers a very high level of protection. Choosing a strong password is essential to the security of your volume. The hidden disk feature in TrueCrypt offers a unique level of security for information stored on the computer. The user needs to have an excellent grasp of the program and its basic functions, as well as an expert assessment of their own security situation, and of when the hidden disk feature might be useful.

Q: Remind me again, how do I mount my original standard volume, rather than the one that's hidden?

A: It all depends on what password you enter in the Password box. If you enter the Standard Volume password, then TrueCrypt will mount that Standard Volume. If you enter the Hidden Volume password, then TrueCrypt will mount that Hidden Volume. If someone demands that you open your TrueCrypt volume so that they can see what type of information is there, you open the standard volume. Hopefully this will be enough to get you off the hook and out of trouble.

Q: Is it possible to inadvertently damage or delete the hidden volume?

A: Yes. If you continue to add files to the TrueCrypt Standard Volume until the there isn't sufficient empty space (for the hidden disk to exist), then your hidden disk will be automatically overwritten. There is an option in the TrueCrypt menu that can protect your hidden disk from being overwritten, but switching this option on may identify the existence of the hidden disk to an adversary when the volume is open.

Q: Can I change the size of the hidden disk after creating it?

A: No. You will have to create another hidden disk and move files to it manually.

Q: Can I use tools like chkdsk, Disk Defragmenter, and others on the contents of a mounted TrueCrypt volume?

A: TrueCrypt volumes behave like real physical disk devices, so it is possible to use any file system checking/repairing/defragmenting tools on the contents of any mounted TrueCrypt volume.

Q: Is it possible to change the password for a Hidden Volume?

A: Yes. The Password change feature applies to both Standard and Hidden Volumes. Just type the password for the hidden volume in the 'Current Password' field of the 'Volume Password Change' prompt screen.

Q: When should I use the hidden disk feature?

A: Use the TrueCrypt hidden disk feature when you need to hide the existence of certain information on your computer. Note that this is different from using a Standard Volume, where you are protecting access to the information.
