# Things you should know about TrueCrypt before you start

**On 28 May 2014 TrueCrypt developers web page started to inform users that TrueCrypt development is discontinued as of now. The circumstances behind this situation are not clear yet. The developers web page is offering a new version 7.2 of TrueCrypt with some functionality removed. Despite this new release we recommend that you continue to use older version 7.1a (see Downloading instructions), until we know more about what has happen and what plans are for the future of TrueCrypt development. For alternatives to TrueCrypt please have a look at the "GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs" section below.**

**TrueCrypt** will protect your data from being accessed by locking it with a password that you will create. If you forget that password, you will lose access to your data! **TrueCrypt** uses a process called encryption to protect your files. Please bear in mind that the use of encryption is illegal in some countries. Rather than encrypting specific files, **TrueCrypt** creates a protected area, called a volume, on your computer. You can safely store your files inside this encrypted volume.

**TrueCrypt** offers the ability to create a standard encrypted volume or a hidden volume. Either one will keep your files confidential, but a hidden volume allows you to hide your important information behind less sensitive data in order to protect it, even if you are forced to reveal your **TrueCrypt** volume. This guide explains both volumes in detail.
