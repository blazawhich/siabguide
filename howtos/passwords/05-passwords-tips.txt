Looking over the list of suggestions above, you might wonder how anyone without a photographic memory could possibly keep track of passwords that are this long, complex and meaningless without writing them down. The importance of using a different password for each account makes this even more difficult. There are a few tricks, however, that might help you create passwords that are easy to remember but extremely difficult to guess, even for a clever person using advanced 'password cracking' software. You also have the option of recording your passwords using a tool like [KeePassX](https://siabnext.ttc.io/how-to-guide/keepassx) that was created specifically for this purpose.

## Remembering secure passwords

It is important to use different types of characters when choosing a password. This can be done in various ways:

- Varying capitalisation, such as: '**My naME is Not MR. MarSter**' 
- Alternating numbers and letters, such as: '**a11 w0Rk 4nD N0 p14Y**' 
- Incorporating certain symbols, such as: '**c@t(heR1nthery3**' 
- Using multiple languages, such as: '**Let Them Eat 1e gateaU au ch()colaT**' 

Any of these methods can help you increase the complexity of an otherwise simple password, which may allow you to choose one that is secure without having to give up entirely on the idea of memorizing it. Some of the more common substitutions (such as the use of a zero instead of an 'o' or the '@' symbol in place of an 'a') were long-ago incorporated into password-cracking tools, but they are still a good idea. They increase the amount of time that such tools would require to learn a password and, in the more common situations where tools of this sort cannot be used, they help prevent lucky guesses.

Passwords can also take advantage of more traditional mnemonic devices, such as the use of acronyms. This allows long phrases to be turned into complex, seemingly-random words: 

- 'To be or not to be? That is the question' becomes '**2Bon2B?TitQ**' 
- 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal' becomes '**WhtT2bs-e:taMac=**' 
- 'Are you happy today?' becomes '**rU:-)2d@y?**' 

These are just a few examples to help you come up with your own method of encoding words and phrases to make them simultaneously complex and memorable.

A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way. Increasing the length of a password even just by a few characters, or by adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to crack. For demonstrative purposes, the table below shows how much longer it may take a hacker to break a list of progressively more complex passwords by trying different combinations of the password one after another.

| Sample password       | Time to crack with an everyday computer | Time to crack with a very fast computer |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| bananas                     | Less than 1 day                                     | Less than 1 day                                  |

Of course, the time it would take to crack any of the above passwords would vary widely depending on the nature of the attack, and the resources available to the attacker. Moreover, new methods to crack passwords are constantly being devised. All the same, the table does demonstrate that passwords become vastly more difficult to break by simply varying characters and using two words or, even better, a short phrase.

The table above is based on [Passfault](https://passfault.appspot.com/password_strength.html)'s calculations. Passfault is one of a number of websites which allow you to test the strength of your passwords. However, while such resources are good for demonstrating the relative efficiency of different types of passwords, you should avoid introducing your actual passwords into these sites.
