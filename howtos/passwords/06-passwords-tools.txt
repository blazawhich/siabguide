# Recording secure passwords

While a little creativity may allow you to remember all of your passwords, the need to change those passwords periodically means that you might quickly run out of creativity. As an alternative, you can generate random, secure passwords for most of your accounts and simply give up on the idea of remembering them all. Instead, you can record them in a portable, encrypted secure password database, such as [KeePassX](keepassx).

Of course, if you use this method, it becomes especially important that you create and remember a very secure password for [KeePassX](keepassx), or whatever tool you choose. Whenever you need to enter a password for a specific account, you can look it up using only your master password, which makes it much easier to follow all of the suggestions above. [KeePassX](keepassx) is portable, as well, which means that you can put the database on a USB memory stick in case you need to look up a password while you are away from your primary computer.

Although it is probably the best option for anybody who has to maintain a large number of accounts, there are a few drawbacks to this method. First, if you lose or accidentally delete your only copy of a password database, you will no longer have access to any of the accounts for which it contained passwords. This makes it extremely important that you back up your KeePassX database. Look over [Chapter 5: How to recover from information loss](chapter-5) for more information on backup strategies. Fortunately, the fact that your database is encrypted means that you don't have to panic if you lose a USB memory stick or a backup drive containing a copy of it. 

The second major drawback could be even more important. If you forget your [KeePassX](keepassx) master password, there is no way to recover it or the contents of the database. So, be sure to choose a master password that is both secure and memorable!

The strength of this method may, in certain situations, become its weakness. If somebody forces you to give away your KeePassX database master password, they will gain access to all of the passwords stored in  the KeePassX database. If this is a situation you may face, you could treat your KeePassX database as a sensitive file, and protect it as we describe in [Chapter 4: How to protect the sensitive files on your computer](chapter-4).  You can also create a separate KeePassX database to contain passwords protecting more sensitive information and take extra precautions with that database.
