Many of the secure services that allow us to feel comfortable using digital technology to conduct important business, from signing in to our computers and sending email to encrypting and hiding sensitive data, require that we remember a password. These secret words, phrases or strings of gibberish often provide the first, and sometimes the only, barrier between your information and anyone who might want to read, copy, modify or destroy it without your permission. There are many ways in which someone could learn your passwords, but you can defend against most of them by applying a few specific tactics and by using a secure password database tool, such as KeePassX.
