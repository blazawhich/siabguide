# Creating your physical security policy

Once you have assessed the threats and vulnerabilities that you or your organisation face, you must consider what steps can be taken to improve your physical security. You should create a detailed [*security policy*] /en/glossary#Security_policy) by putting these steps in writing. The resulting document will serve as a general guideline for yourself, your colleagues and any newcomers to your organisation. It should also provide a checklist of what actions should be taken in the event of various different physical security emergencies. Everybody involved should take the time to read, implement and keep up with these security standards. They should also be encouraged to ask questions and
propose suggestions on how to improve the document.

Your physical [*security policy*](/en/glossary#Security_policy) may contain various sections, depending on the circumstances:

- An office access policy that addresses the alarm systems, what keys exist and who has them, when guests are allowed in the office, who holds the cleaning contract and other such issues	
- A policy on which parts of the office should be restricted to authorized visitors	
- An inventory of your equipment, including serial numbers and physical descriptions	
- A plan for securely disposing of paper rubbish that contains sensitive information	
- Emergency procedures related to:
 - Who should be notified if sensitive information is disclosed or misplaced		
 - Who to contact in the event of a fire, flood, or other natural disaster		
 - How to perform certain key emergency repairs		
 - How to contact the companies or organizations that provide services such as electrical power, water and Internet access
 - How to recover information from your off-site backup system. You can find more detailed backup advice in [***Chapter 5: How to recover from information loss***](/en/chapter-5).

Your [*security policy*](/en/glossary#Security_policy) should be reviewed periodically and modified to reflect any policy changes that have been made since its last review. And, of course, don't forget to back up your [*security policy*](/en/glossary#Security_policy) document along with the rest of your important data. See the [***Further reading***](/en/chapter_2_5) section for more information about creating a [*security policy*](/en/glossary#Security_policy).
