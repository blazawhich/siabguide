# Anti-virus software

There is an excellent [*freeware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Freeware) anti-virus program for Windows called [*Avast*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Avast), which is easy to use, regularly updated and well-respected by anti-virus experts. It requires that you register once every 14 months, but registration, updates and the program itself are all free-of-charge.

There are various other well-known commercial anti-virus programs as alternatives to Avast. [*Clam*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Clam_Win) Win is a [*FOSS*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#FOSS) alternative to [*Avast*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Avast). Although it lacks certain features that are important for a primary anti-virus program, [*Clam*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Clam_Win) has the advantage that it can be run from a USB memory stick in order to scan a device on which you are not allowed to install software.

# Anti-spyware software

You can use anti-spyware tools to protect your computer from this type of threat. [*Spybot*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Spybot) is one such program, and it does a very good job of identifying and removing certain types of malware that anti-virus programs simply ignore. Just like with anti-virus software, though, it is extremely important that you update Spybot's [*malware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Malware) definitions and run regular scans.

# Firewalls

A firewall is the first program on a computer that sees incoming data from the Internet. It is also the last program to handle outgoing information. Like a security guard, posted at the door of a building to decide who can enter and who can leave, a firewall receives, inspects and makes decisions about all incoming and outgoing data. Naturally, it is critical that you defend yourself against untrusted connections from the Internet and from local networks, either of which could give hackers and viruses a clear path to your computer. In fact, though, monitoring outgoing connections originating from your own computer is no less important.

A good firewall allows you to choose access permissions for each program on your computer. When one of these programs tries to contact the outside world, your firewall will block the attempt and give you a warning unless it recognizes the program and verifies that you have given it permission to make that sort of connection. This is largely to prevent existing [*malware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Malware) from spreading viruses or inviting hackers into your computer. In this regard, a firewall provides both a second line of defense and an early-warning system that might help you recognize when your computer's security is being threatened.

## Firewall software

Recent versions of Microsoft Windows include a built-in firewall, which is now turned on automatically. Unfortunately, the Windows firewall is limited in many ways, for example, it does not examine outgoing connections. However, there is an excellent [*freeware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Freeware) program called [*Comodo Personal Firewall*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Comodo_Firewall), which does a better job of keeping your computer secure.
