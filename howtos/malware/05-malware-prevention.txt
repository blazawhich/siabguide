# Preventing virus infection

* Be extremely cautious when opening email attachments, any files received (e.g. over Instant Messaging like MSN, Skype, etc.) or downloaded from the Internet. It is best to avoid opening any files received from an unknown source. If you need to do so, you should first save the attachment to a folder on your computer, then open the appropriate application (such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat) yourself. If you use the program's File menu to open the attachment manually, rather than double-clicking the file or allowing your email program to open it automatically, you are less likely to contract a virus.

* Consider the possible risks before inserting removable media, such as CDs, DVDs and USB memory sticks, into your computer. You should first check that your anti-virus program has the latest updates and that its scanner is running. It is also a good idea to disable your operating system's AutoPlay feature, which can be used by viruses to infect your computer. Under Windows XP, this can be done by going inside **My Computer**, right-clicking on your CD or DVD drive, selecting **Properties** and clicking on the **AutoPlay** tab. For each content type, select the **Take no action** or **Prompt me each time to choose an action** options then click **OK**.

* You can also help prevent some virus infections by switching to free and open source software, which is often more secure, and which virus writers are less likely to target.

# Preventing spyware infection

* Stay alert when browsing websites. Watch for browser windows that appear automatically, and read them carefully instead of just clicking **Yes** or **OK**. When in doubt, you should close 'pop up windows' by clicking the **X** in the upper right-hand corner, rather than by clicking **Cancel**. This can help prevent webpages from tricking you into installing [*malware*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Malware) on your computer.
* Improve the security of your Web browser by preventing it from automatically running the potentially dangerous programs that are sometimes contained within webpages you visit. If you are using Mozilla [*Firefox*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Firefox), you can install the [*NoScript*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#NoScript) add-on, as described in [**Section 4**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/firefox_noscript) of the [**Firefox Guide**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/firefox_main).
* Never accept and run this sort of content if it comes from websites that you don't know or trust.

# Preventing untrusted network connections

* Only install essential programs on the computer you use for sensitive work, and make sure you get them from a reputable source. Uninstall any software that you do not use.
* Disconnect your computer from the Internet when you are not using it and shut it down completely overnight
* Do not share your Windows password with anyone.
* If you have enabled any 'Windows services' that you are no longer using, you should disable them. See the [**Further reading**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/chapter_1_5) section for more about this
* Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed
* If you do not already have one, you should consider installing an additional firewall to protect the entire local network at your office. Many commercial broadband [*gateways*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Router) include an easy-to-use firewall, and turning it on can make your network much more secure. If you are not sure where to start with this, you might want to ask for assistance from whoever helped set up your network
