# Tips on using anti-virus software effectively

* Do not run two anti-virus programs at the same time, as this might cause your computer to run extremely slowly or to crash. Uninstall one before installing another.

* Make sure that your anti-virus program allows you to receive updates. Many commercial tools that come pre-installed on new computers must be registered (and paid for) at some point or they will stop receiving updates. All of the software recommended here supports free updating.

* Ensure that your anti-virus software updates itself regularly. New viruses are written and distributed every day, and your computer will quickly become vulnerable if you do not keep up with new virus definitions. [*Avast*](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/glossary#Avast) will automatically look for updates when you are connected to the Internet.

* Enable your anti-virus software's 'always on' virus-detection feature if it has one. Different tools have different names for it, but most of them offer a feature like this. It may be called 'Realtime Protection,' 'Resident Protection,' or something similar. Take a look at [**Section 3.2.1**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/howtouseavast#Section_3.2.1) of the [**Avast Guide**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/avast_main) to learn more about that tool's 'Resident Scanner.'

* Scan all of the files on your computer regularly. You don't have to do this every day (especially if your anti-virus software has an 'always on' feature, as described above) but you should do it from time to time. How often may depend on the circumstances. Have you connected your computer to unknown networks recently? With whom have you been sharing USB memory sticks? Do you frequently receive strange attachments by email? Has someone else in your home or office recently had virus problems? For more information on how best to scan files, see the [**Avast Guide**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/avast_main).
