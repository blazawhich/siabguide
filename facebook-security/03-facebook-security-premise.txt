# Social networking platforms

These social networking security guides aim to help you navigate the privacy and security settings of a few popular social networking platforms, with a view toward making them more secure (though less insecure is perhaps a better way of putting it). Specifically, step-by step guides are provided for Facebook and Twitter, and some general guidelines are provided for YouTube and Flickr.

These social networking websites are the most popular and widely used social networking tools. They are owned by private companies and, as noted in chapter [**9. How to protect yourself and your data when using social networking sites**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/chapter-9), these companies make their money by collecting information about users and selling it on to advertisers.

Government crackdowns will target these sites first and block them, and the companies will cave into government pressures and censor when necessary. If they are not blocked, they are actively monitored by numerous governments who collect user metadata and make requests for private information about individuals of interest, often including human rights defenders. Note, in this regard, that companies managing social networking servers have access to **all your information**, including your private data and password.

It may be worth looking at alternatives to these sites, such as [**Diaspora**](http://joindiaspora.com/), [**Crabgrass**](https://securityinabox.org/en/context/01/crabgrass-online-collaboration), [**Friendica**](http://friendica.com/), [**Pidder**](https://pidder.com/), or [**SecureShare**](http://secushare.org/) which have been designed with digital security and activism in mind. The [**Social Swarm**](http://socialswarm.net/) is a think-tank run by a not-for-profit organisation which carries out discussions, awareness-raising and campaigns related to privacy on social networks, and may be a useful learning resource.

Other similar sites may be popular in different regions, so you way wish to explore other options. Before choosing one you should consider the following points:

1. Does it provide connection over **SSL** (like https) for all uses of the site, rather than just during login? Are there no problems related to encryption, such as problems related to encryption certificates?
2. Read the End User Licence Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully. How are your content and personal data treated? With whom are they shared? For a useful add-on which helps users undestand the Terms of Service of many popular sites, see [**Terms of Service; Didn't Read**](http://tosdr.org/)
3. What privacy options are provided for users? Can you choose to share your videos securely with a small number of individuals, or are they all public by default?
4. Do you know the **geographical location of the servers**, under which territorial jurisdiction they fall or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information? Will the site's owners hand over information if they receive a governmental request to do so?

## Things you should know about Facebook before you start

**Facebook** is the world's most popular social networking site. It can be and has been used widely by human rights advocates in order to build networks, communicate, organise and publicise events or issues. However, it is also a potentially rich source of information for those opposed to the activities of rights advocates. Therefore, knowledge of the different account and privacy settings available is extremely important.

**Facebook** is actively monitored by numerous governments, including the United States government. Moreover, **Facebook**'s Data Use Policy states that they will share your information in response to legal requests including governmental investigations.

It is important to keep in mind that, due to the open nature of **Facebook**, your security and privacy depends heavily on that of your friends and contacts. While practicing these guidelines alone will give you more privacy and security, it will be much less effective if your Facebook contacts do not practice them too. Therefore, it's important to spread these practices among your friends, family and other contacts on **Facebook** so as to improve your security, as well as theirs.

Many people use **Facebook Groups** as a way of communicating and organising socially, politically and professionally. While Facebook gives you the ability to create a "secret" group, it's worth noting that all the information shared in such groups is shared not only between members but also with Facebook and whoever has access to their data, which can include state agencies or other third parties who request it. As an alternative we recommend the **Crabgrass** service provided by **RiseUp.Net**, although it's worth noting that it is specifically designed for activism. For more, see [*Hands-on: Crabgrass Secure Online Collaboration Platform*](https://securityinabox.org/en/context/01/crabgrass-online-collaboration).

You should always stay up-to-date on the **Facebook Privacy Settings**. The settings outlined in this guide will help keep your Facebook account more secure (as of June 2014). However, it is always advisable to look at the official **Facebook [help page](https://www.facebook.com/help/privacy)** for Privacy and Security settings for any updates, or advice for any questions you may have.
