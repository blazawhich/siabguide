**KeePassX** is easy-to-use, cross-platform, free and open-source software (FOSS) that allows you to store all of your passwords in one secure, portable database.

If you use KeePassX consistently for a particular account, you never actually have to know (or even *see*) your password for that application or service. The tool's *copy/paste* function takes care of moving the relevant password from the database to the required login form, then wiping it from *clipboard* memory. If, for example, you take advantage of the *Random Generator* feature of KeePassX, then configure your email account to use the generated password, you will be relying on a strong password that you have never actually seen. But it will still work! Just *remember to backup your KeePassX database!*
