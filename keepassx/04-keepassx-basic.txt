# Create a new KeePassX database

In order to create a new password database, you must do three things:
1.  Create a new database
2.  Choose a strong master passphrase that you will use to unlock your database of passwords
3.  Save the password database

## Step 1

1. Click *File*
2. Click *New Database*

## Step 2

1. Choose a strong master passphrase and type it in
* **It is very important that your master passphrase be unique, long, complex and difficult to guess. Unfortunately, it must also be *memorable*. (After all, you can't keep your KeePassX master passphrase inside KeePassX, and writing it down would sort of defeat the purpose of using an encrypted password database.) If you forget it, however, you will lose access to everything in your database. So, take your time and come up with a good one!**
2. If you want to see the master passphrase you have chosen, proceed to the next *Step*. Otherwise, click "OK"

## Step 3 (optional)

* **You might want to skip this step, especially if you think someone may be looking over your shoulder.**
1. If you want a quick look at the master passphrase you have chosen, click the "eye" button
2. This will reveal your chosen master passphrase
* When you are done, remember to click the "eye" button a second time or your passphrase will be visible on the following screen, as well

## Step 4

1. Enter your  chosen master passphrase a second time to make sure you got it right
2. Click *OK*

## Step 5

* **Congratulations, you have *almost* created a new KeePassX database. Now you must save it, just like you would any other electronic document**
* Note the small asterisk (*) in the KeePassX title bar. When you see that, it means you have made a change to your database and must save it before you close it or quit KeePassX
1. Click *File*
2. Click *Save Database As*

## Step 6

* In this example, we save our KeePassX database in the *Documents* library, but you can put it anywhere. If you store it on a USB flash memory stick, along with a copy of the KeePassX application folder, you will be able to access your passwords using other computers
1. Click on the *Documents* library
2. Type in a name for your KeePassX database file. In this example, we call our database *passwords.kdb*, but you can name it anything you like.
* **If you are worried that someone with access to your computer might see this file and demand that you tell them your master passphrase, you should probably come up with a less conspicuous name**
3. Click *Save*

## Step 7
