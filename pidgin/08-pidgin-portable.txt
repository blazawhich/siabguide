# Portable Pidgin and OTR for Windows

## Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Pidgin

Given that portable tools are *not* installed on a local computer, their existence and use will remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses. 

There are no other differences between **Portable Pidgin** and the version designed to be installed on a local computer.
