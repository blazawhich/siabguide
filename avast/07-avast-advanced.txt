# Advanced Virus Removal Methods

Sometimes the protection offered by **avast!**, **Comodo Firewall** and **Spybot** is simply not sufficient; despite our best efforts, our personal and work systems *do* become infected by malware and other viruses. In section [**4.1 A Short Guide to Dealing with Virus Outbreaks**](#4.1), a few methods were offered for dealing with persistent malware and viruses. However, there *is* more that can be done to eliminate such threats from your computer.

**Method A: Using Anti-malware Rescue CDs/DVDs**

Some anti-malware software companies also offer a free anti-virus 'rescue' CD/DVD. These can be downloaded in ISO image format (that is, a format that can be easily burned onto a CD or DVD). 

To begin using these anti-malware CDs/DVDs, perform the following tasks:

1. Download and burn the anti-malware program to a CD.  
*You can use free program like [**ImgBurn**](http://www.imgburn.com/) to burn the image to the disk.*

2. Insert the disk to infected computers, CD/DVD player and then restart your computer from this CD/DVD.  
*Often you can do this by pressing key F10 or F12 on your keyboard just after switching on the computer. Pay special attention to the instruction on the screen of your computer while it starts to learn how to do this on your computer.*

3. Re-connect your system to the Internet so that the anti-malware program will automatically update its virus definitions if necessary, after which it will begin scanning your computer hard drives to remove any detected software threats. 

The following is a list of rescue CDs images:

- [**AVG Rescue CD**](http://www.avg.com/us-en/avg-rescue-cd)
- [**BitDefender Rescue CD**](http://www.bitdefender.com/support/How-to-create-a-BitDefender-Rescue-CD-627.html)
- [**F-Secure Rescue CD**](http://www.f-secure.com/linux-weblog/files/f-secure-rescue-cd-release-3.00.zip)
- [**Kaspersky Rescue CD**](http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/rescuedisk/)
- [**Dr.Web Live Rescue CD**](http://www.freedrweb.com/livecd/)

You may also scan your computer using the following tools, which run when the **Windows OS** is started; however, these tools work only if the virus infecting your computer is not stopping them from operating:

- [**HijackThis**](http://free.antivirus.com/hijackthis/) and other tools from free [Clean-up Tools](http://free.antivirus.com/clean-up-tools/) from **Trend Micro** company.
- [**RootkitRevealer**](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897445.aspx) from [Sysinternals](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals) from **Microsoft**.

**Note:** You can use each tool listed above separately to maximise your ability to effectively clean your computer.

**Method B: Re Installing the Microsoft Windows Operating System**

***Note**: Before you begin, make sure you have all the appropriate license or serial numbers, and installation copies for the **Windows OS** and other programs you require. This procedure may be time consuming but worth the effort if you can't eliminate malware and virus threats the other way.*

In rare instances, a virus infection can be *so* destructive that the software tools recommended earlier may be rendered useless. In situations like this, we recommend that you perform the following tasks: 

1. Create a backup or copy of all your personal files on the computer.

2. Reinstall the **Microsoft Windows** operating system formatting the entire disk.

3. Update the **Microsoft Windows** operating system after the installation has been completed.

4. Install **avast!** (or your preferred anti-virus program) and update it.

5. Install whatever programs you require and remember to download the latest versions and all the updates for each program. <br><br>**Note**: Under no circumstances should you connect your backup disk to your computer *before* you have successfully performed these tasks. You might risk infecting your computer again.

6. Connect your backup disk to your computer and scan it thoroughly to detect and eliminate any existing problems. 

7. After you have detected and deleted any problems, you may copy your files from the backup disk to the computer hard drive.
