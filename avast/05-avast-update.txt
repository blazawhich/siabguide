# How to Manually Update avast!

## Before You Begin

**avast!** runs silently in the background on your computer, automatically updating its virus definitions and program upgrades every time you connect to the Internet. However, in situations where your internet access is discontinuous, restricted or temporary in some way, performing a manual update would be more convenient or useful.

**Note**: There are two ways of updating **avast!** manually: The first is through the **avast!** main user interface, and the second is through a pop-up menu that appears whenever you right click the **avast!** icon located in the *System Tray*. Furthermore, you can simply turn off the automatic update feature through the *BASIC SETTINGS* pop-up window, when you **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-90.png) at the top right corner of the main user interface.

## How to Use the Main User Interface to Manually Update avast!

To manually update **avast!** through the main user interface, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-20.png) to activate the **avast!** main user interface as follows:

*Figure 1: The Summary tab displaying the Current Status pane, displaying a typical notification of a Program version update*

A program or virus definition update is indicated by an orange icon with a centred exclamation mark, instead of the usual green icon with a check mark. The program or virus definition update version is displayed in red, and the *Update* button now is now visible.

### Step 2

The following list briefly describes each item or status icon in the *Current Status SECURED* pane as follows:

**Tip**: **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-14.png) to either display or hide the information in the *Current Status* pane. 

**Real-time shields**: This icon indicates whether the real-time shields are working properly. The real-time shields monitor all computer-related activities; there are real-time shields for email, the local file system, the web and other systems. If or when one real-time shield is turned off, either deliberately or by a malware attack, the **avast!** icon in the *System Tray* changes appearance to reflect this: ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-40.png)

**Definitions auto updates**: This icon indicates whether the automated update mechanism is turned off or on. 

**Virus definitions version**: This icon displays the date stamp of the most recent virus definition version. The date is displayed according to the following format: 10 refers to the year 2010, 06 refers to the month and 29 refers to the day. 

**Program version**: This icon displays the most recent update of the program version.

**Expiration date**: This item displays the expiration date and time of your copy of **avast!**, and is the date before which it should be renewed or re-registered.

### Step 3

The *Maintenance UPDATE* pane is used to update the program and virus definitions manually. 

### Step 4
