# Take photos with ObscuraCam

You can use **ObscuraCam** to hide some or all of the faces that appear in your photos. It works on pictures that you take with the **ObscuraCam** app itself, but you can also blur faces in other photos, as long as you have a way to copy or move the image files onto your Android device.

To take a photo on your Android device without showing your subjects' faces, perform the following steps: 

## Step 1

**Tap** the **Camera** button

## Step 2

**Take** a photo by clicking on ![](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-08.png)[ObscuraCam img 07]

## Step 3

**Tap** the **Save** button by clicking on ![](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-09.png)[ObscuraCam img 08]

**ObscuraCam** will attempt to identify faces automatically. For each face that it recognizes, it will add an image "*tag*" (a rectangle used to select content that should be hidden).

## Step 4

**Select** or **modify** the content you want to hide

Image tags can be modified in the following ways:

- **Tap** a portion of your photo that you want to hide in order to add a tag.
- **Tap** an existing tag (the border should turn green) and then tap *Delete Tag* in order to remove it

*Figure 9: Tagging options*

**Tap** and **drag** the very centre of a tag in order to move it (thereby changing which portion of your image will be hidden).

**Tap** and **drag** close to one side of the tag (but inside the rectangle) in order to change the size and shape of the tag.

# Hide faces in existing photos

To hide your subjects' faces in an existing photo, perform the following steps: 

## Step 1

**Copy or move** the desired image file onto your Android device, if it is not already there.

## Step 2

**Tap** the ![Photos](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-14.png)[ObscuraCam img 12] button.

## Step 3

**Select** the photo which you want to edit.

**ObscuraCam** will attempt to identify faces **automatically**.

*Figure 12: Automatically detected face*

## Step 4

**Select** or **modify** the content you want to hide.

# Change the "blur" mode

There are different modes which you could select in order to blur the face in the picture you want in different ways. 
**Click** on the center of the green border of the image to see the different options as shown below

**First option:** If you **click** on ![Redact](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-21.png)[ObscuraCam img 13] your image will look like the following:

*Figure 13: A redacted face*

**Second option:** If you **click** on ![Pixelate](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-22.png)[ObscuraCam img 15] your image will look like the following:

# Share photos

**Note:** Make sure that you remove all metadata from the photos that you are taking with your Android phone before sharing it with anyone. Hiding the identity of the photographed person using **Obscuracam** doesn't remove the metadata which has a lot of details including location, camera specifications, and other information.

You can share the photos you created with **Obscuracam** by following the below steps:

## Step 1

Click on ![](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-26.png)[ObscuraCam img 20] or on *Menu* and then *Share* to open the image sharing options.

![Image sharing options](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-20.png)[ObscuraCam img 21] ![](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-19.png)[ObscuraCam img 22]

*Figure 17 and 18: Image sharing options*

## Step 2

Choose the service that you want to use to share the image you want with your network.

# Delete original media

## Step 1

When clicking *Save*, a window will appear asking if you want to delete the original media file. 

![Deletion option](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-17.png)[ObscuraCam img 23]

*Figure 18: Deletion option*

## Step 2

**Click** on **Yes** if the original media file on your smartphone would put you or other people at risk. 

## Step 3

If you wish to delete a picture from a gallery or photo album, first of all, **select** the image that you want to delete from your gallery or any other image viewer application you are using.

![Menu](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-18.png)[ObscuraCam img 24]

*Figure 19: Menu*

## Step 4

**Click** on **Delete** as shown below

![delete option](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-27.png)[ObscuraCam img 25]

*Figure 20: The delete option*

**Note:** In Android 2.2 you might not be able to delete the original media file. In case this happens, connect your Android device with your computer so you can delete the original image.
