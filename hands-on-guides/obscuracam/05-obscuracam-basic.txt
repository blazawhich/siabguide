# Take photos with ObscuraCam

You can use **ObscuraCam** to hide some or all of the faces that appear in your photos. It works on pictures that you take with the **ObscuraCam** app itself, but you can also blur faces in other photos, as long as you have a way to copy or move the image files onto your Android device.

To take a photo on your Android device without showing your subjects' faces, perform the following steps: 

## Step 1

**Tap** the **Camera** button

## Step 2

**Take** a photo by clicking on ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-08.png)

## Step 3

**Tap** the **Save** button by clicking on ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-09.png)

**ObscuraCam** will attempt to identify faces automatically. For each face that it recognizes, it will add an image "*tag*" (a rectangle used to select content that should be hidden).

## Step 4

**Select** or **modify** the content you want to hide

Image tags can be modified in the following ways:

- **Tap** a portion of your photo that you want to hide in order to add a tag.
- **Tap** an existing tag (the border should turn green) and then tap *Delete Tag* in order to remove it

**Tap** and **drag** the very centre of a tag in order to move it (thereby changing which portion of your image will be hidden).

**Tap** and **drag** close to one side of the tag (but inside the rectangle) in order to change the size and shape of the tag.

# Hide faces in existing photos

To hide your subjects' faces in an existing photo, perform the following steps: 

## Step 1

**Copy or move** the desired image file onto your Android device, if it is not already there.

## Step 2

**Tap** the ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/obscuracam-and-14.png) button.

## Step 3

**Select** the photo which you want to edit.

**ObscuraCam** will attempt to identify faces **automatically**.
