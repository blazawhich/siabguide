# How to Use Eraser

## Use Eraser in Windows Explorer

It is common for people to use **Eraser** through the **My Computer Windows Explorer** programs, rather than through the **Eraser** program itself. 

### Step 1

**Open** a folder containing a file you want to delete permanently.

### Step 2

**Right-click** on this file. Two new options appear on the pop-up menu, *Erase* and *Eraser Secure Move* as follows:

![Erase and Eraser Secure Move options](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/14.png)[Eraser img 14]

*Figure 1: Erase and Eraser Secure Move options*

We are going to use the *Erase* option to permanently delete this file.

### Step 3

**Select** the **Erase** item from the menu, as shown in *Figure 1* above.

*The Confirm Erasing pop up dialog box will appear as follows*:

![Confirm Erasing pop up dialog box](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/15.png)[Eraser img 15]

*Figure 2: The Confirm Erasing pop up dialog box*

If the file displayed in the pop up dialog box is the one you want to delete permanently, perform the following step:

### Step 4

**Click** ![Yes](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/16.png)[Eraser img 16] to *permanently* erase or wipe the file from your computer.

**Warning**: Any file deleted in this manner with be *irretrievably* and permanently deleted. Therefore, you must be completely sure that you really want to erase a particular file, or group of files. 

To securely move a file/s from one location to another (for example, from your computer to a USB memory stick):

### Step 5

**Select** ![Eraser Secure Move](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/17.png)[Eraser img 17]

You will need to answer the same warning prompt, as above, to continue.

## Wipe Unused Disk Space

Erasing unused disk space involves wiping all traces of previously existing files from the 'empty
space' of your hard drive/portable storage device. This empty space usually contains files that were not deleted properly (please refer to the [**Recuva**](https://securityinabox.org/recuva_main)[Recuva Main] **Hands-on** guide and the **How-to Booklet** [**Chapter 6**](https://securityinabox.org/chapter-6)[Sensitive Information] from more information about this).

### Step 1**. **Select Start > Programs > Eraser > Eraser**

**Tip**: You can perform the wiping task on demand or you can schedule it to occur at a specified time. 

**Important**: This process could take between 2 and 5 hours to complete and will slow your computer down while it operates. It maybe a good idea to run or schedule the free space wipe when you are not using your computer (or have gone home/to bed for the night).

## Use the On-Demand Task Feature

To create an *On-Demand* task for wiping *unused disk space*, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/18.png)[Eraser img 18]

### Step 2

**Select File > New Task** as follows: 

![Selecting a New Task in the File menu](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/19.png)[Eraser img 19]

*Figure 3: Selecting a New Task in the File menu*

The *Unused space on drive* option should be selected. 

### Step 3

**Choose** the drive you want to clear the free space on. (In this example, the *Local Disk (C:)* has been selected. This is usually the primary hard drive on most computers.) 

![Eraser Task Properties](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/20.png)[Eraser img 20]

*Figure 4: The Eraser Task Properties screen*

### Step 4

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/21.png)[Eraser img 21] to create, and then run the task which will appear in the **Eraser** user interface.

### Step 5

**Right-click** the task to activate the pop-up menu as follows:

![Eraser screen with Run selected](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/22.png)[Eraser img 22]

*Figure 5: The Eraser screen with Run selected*

### Step 6

**Select Run** to activate the **Eraser** pop up dialog box as follows:

![Eraser pop up dialog box](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/23.png)[Eraser img 23]

*Figure 6: The Eraser pop up dialog box*

### Step 7

**Click** ![Yes](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/16.png)[Eraser img 16].

*The **Eraser** progress status window displays the wiping process on the unused disk space as follows:*

*Figure 7: The Eraser window in the process of wiping unused disk space*

## Use the Scheduler

Since we may not always remember to do this kind of computer 'housekeeping', **Eraser** has an option that lets you schedule a wiping task so that it runs at an appointed time every day, or one day per week.

### Step 1

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/25.png)[Eraser img 25] in the **Eraser** main screen.

### Step 2

**Select File > New Task** as follows:

![Selecting a New Task in the File menu](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/26.png)[Eraser img 26]

*Figure 8: Selecting a New Task in the File menu*

This will activate a window similar screen to *Figure 4* (in which you created an on-demand task). 

### Step 3

**Set** these options as outlined in section [**3.2 How to Use the on-Demand Tasks Option**](https://securityinabox.org/using_eraser#3.2)[Eraser Howto #3.2].

![Eraser Task Properties - Schedule tab](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/27.png)[Eraser img 27]

*Figure 9: The Eraser Task Properties screen displaying the Schedule tab*

### Step 4

**Click** the *Schedule* tab to activate its associated pane with two configurable settings: 

![Eraser Schedule tab](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/28.png)[Eraser img 28]

*Figure 10: The Eraser Schedule tab*

### Step 5

**Select** day or event item that best suits your needs from the *Every* drop-down list.

### Step 6

**Enter** the time that best suits your needs in the *At* timer, which can only be entered in a 24-hour format.

### Step 7

After you have set a time and day, **click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/21.png)[Eraser img 21].

*The scheduled task will appear as follows*:

![Eraser Scheduled task list](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/29.png)[Eraser img 29]

*Figure 11: The Eraser Scheduled task list*

**Note**: The computer must be switched on for the scheduled task to run.

## Remove a Task

After you have run either an on-demand task or a scheduled task, you may want to remove it from your task list. 

To remove an on-demand task, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/18.png)[Eraser img 18] to display its corresponding task list as follows:

![Eraser task list](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/30.png)[Eraser img 30]

*Figure 12: The Eraser task list*

### Step 2

**Select** the task you want to remove, as shown in *Figure 12* above. 

### Step 3

**Right-click** to activate the pop-up menu and **select** the *Delete* item to remove the task from the task list. (Alternatively, you may **click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/31.png)[Eraser img 31] located beneath the **Eraser** menu bar.

The process for removing a *Scheduled Task* is almost identical. To remove a scheduled task, perform the following step:

### Step 1

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/25.png)[Eraser img 25], and then **repeat** ### Steps** 2 and 3, as described in this section.

## Erase the Windows Recycle Bin

**Eraser** also allows you to erase any traces of documents you may have deleted from the **Windows Desktop Recycle Bin**. 

To access this feature, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Right click** anywhere on the **Recycle Bin** icon to activate the **Eraser** pop-up menu as follows:

![Eraser pop-up menu for Recycle Bin](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/eraser-en/32.png)[Eraser img 32]

*Figure 13: The Eraser pop-up menu for the Recycle Bin*

### Step 2

**Select** the appropriate item from the pop-up menu to begin erasing your **Recycle Bin**.
