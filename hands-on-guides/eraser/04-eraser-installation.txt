# Install Eraser

Installing **Eraser** is an easy and quick process. To begin installing **Eraser**, perform the following steps:

As described in the How-to Booklet chapter [**6. Destroying Sensitive Information**](/chapter-6), **Eraser** wipes data from your hard disk by overwriting it with random information. The more times you overwrite the data, the less likely that it will be recovered.

## Step 1

**Double click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-01.png); the *Open File - Security Warning* dialog box may appear. If it does, **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-02.png) to activate the *InstallAware Wizard*; after some moments, the *Welcome to the InstallAware Wizard for Eraser* screen will appear.

## Step 2

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-03.png) to activate the *License Agreement* screen, and then **click** checkbox to enable the *I accept the terms of the license agreement* option, and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-03.png) again to activate the *Important Information* window.

## Step 3

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-03.png) after reading the contents displayed in the scrolling window to activate the *Destination Folder* window and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-03.png) again.

## Step 4

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/eraser-win-03.png) to activate the following screen:

## Step 5

## Step 6
