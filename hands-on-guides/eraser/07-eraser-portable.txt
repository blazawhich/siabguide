## Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Eraser

Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.

**Portable Eraser** does not require the **.Net Framework** in order to run, and the extraction and installation time required is minimal. Aside from that, there are no other differences between **Portable Eraser** and the version designed to be installed on a local computer.
