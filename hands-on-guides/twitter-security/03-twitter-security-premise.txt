# Social networking platforms

These social networking security guides aim to help you navigate the privacy and security settings of a few popular social networking platforms, with a view toward making them more secure (though less insecure is perhaps a better way of putting it). Specifically, step-by step guides are provided for Facebook and Twitter, and some general guidelines are provided for YouTube and Flickr.

These social networking websites are the most popular and widely used social networking tools. They are owned by private companies and, as noted in chapter [**9. How to protect yourself and your data when using social networking sites**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/chapter-9)[Social Networks], these companies make their money by collecting information about users and selling it on to advertisers.

Government crackdowns will target these sites first and block them, and the companies will cave into government pressures and censor when necessary. If they are not blocked, they are actively monitored by numerous governments who collect user metadata and make requests for private information about individuals of interest, often including human rights defenders. Note, in this regard, that companies managing social networking servers have access to **all your information**, including your private data and password.

It may be worth looking at alternatives to these sites, such as [**Diaspora**](http://joindiaspora.com/), [**Crabgrass**](https://securityinabox.org/en/context/01/crabgrass-online-collaboration)[Crabgrass Main], [**Friendica**](http://friendica.com/), [**Pidder**](https://pidder.com/), or [**SecureShare**](http://secushare.org/) which have been designed with digital security and activism in mind. The [**Social Swarm**](http://socialswarm.net/) is a think-tank run by a not-for-profit organisation which carries out discussions, awareness-raising and campaigns related to privacy on social networks, and may be a useful learning resource.

Other similar sites may be popular in different regions, so you way wish to explore other options. Before choosing one you should consider the following points:

1. Does it provide connection over **SSL** (like http*s*) for all uses of the site, rather than just during login? Are there no problems related to encryption, such as problems related to encryption certificates?
2. Read the End User Licence Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully. How are your content and personal data treated? With whom are they shared? For a useful add-on which helps users undestand the Terms of Service of many popular sites, see [**Terms of Service; Didn't Read**](http://tosdr.org/)
3. What privacy options are provided for users? Can you choose to share your videos securely with a small number of individuals, or are they all public by default?
4. Do you know the **geographical location of the servers**, under which territorial jurisdiction they fall or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information? Will the site's owners hand over information if they receive a governmental request to do so?

## Things you should know about Twitter before you start

**Twitter** states in its terms of service: “This license is you authorising us to make your Tweets available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. But what’s yours is yours – you own your content.” Moreover, **Twitter** reserves the right to hand over your information to governments should a request be made.

Though **Twitter** is a website, many people interact with and manage **Twitter** via desktop and smartphone applications that are known as **Twitter** clients. If you use a **Twitter** client you should make sure it is connecting to the site securely, over an encrypted connection, see [**Keeping your webmail private**](/en/chapter_7_1)[Securing Email] in [**Chapter 7: How to keep your Internet communication private**](/en/chapter-7)[Private Communication].

Furthermore, like **Facebook**, many people use **Twitter** in conjunction with numerous other websites and applications in order to share status updates, photos, locations, links, and so forth. Using these applications pose many potential security vulnerabilities, and it is very important that the privacy settings on all other applications are made as secure as possible.

Twitter is actively monitored by numerous governments, including the United States government. Moreover, Twitter's Terms of Service states that they will share your information in response to legal requests including governmental investigations.
