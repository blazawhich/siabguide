**Twitter** is a social network in which people share information via 140-character *status updates*. These updates originally responded to the question "what are you doing now?", although it has since evolved as a means of spreading various types of information. Unlike **Facebook**, on **Twitter** you 'follow' other users who interest you, rather than people you actually know.
