***Q***: Are there file types which are impossible for **Recuva** to recover?

***A***: No, **Recuva** can recover all file types.

***Q***: Can I recover a file that has been securely deleted?

***A***: Once it's been securely deleted, it's gone forever.

***Q***: I've noticed that sometimes, even after I've securely deleted a file, it's still marked as recoverable. How is this possible?

***A***: It's possible that you are seeing a file marker, an indicator of where the original file was located. However, if you recover and open that file, you will find its contents unreadable.

***Q***: I deleted a file accidentally; having created it less than five minutes ago, I thought it would be easily recoverable. How come **Recuva** was unable to recover it?

***A***: Ironically, a document or file existing for only few minutes has  greater likelihood of being overwritten by temporary files than one which has existed for a longer period. **Recuva** doesn't easily recover files which have been deleted almost immediately after creation.

***Q***: After I've cleaned my computer system using **CCleaner**, can that data be recovered later?

***A***: Depending on the skill and resources available to someone attempting such a recovery, it's possible. It also depends on the secure deletion settings you used for cleaning your temporary files and the **Windows Registry** in **CCleaner**. To minimize their ability to recover your private and sensitive information, enable the Secure Deletion option in **CCleaner**, and wipe any empty space on hard drives and in the **Windows Master File Table**. In **Recuva**, you can increase the number of passes for securely overwriting data as well. This is a great question because it also shows you how different tools complement each other, in your efforts to protect your digital privacy and security.
