# Things You Should Know about gpg4usb Before You Start

**gpg4usb** is a simple, lightweight and portable program that lets you encrypt and decrypt text messages and files. **gpg4usb** is based on public-key cryptography. In this method, each individual must generate her/his own personal **key pair**. The first key is known as the **private key**. It is protected by a password or passphrase, guarded and *never* shared with anyone.

The second key is known as the **public key**. This key can be shared with any of your correspondents - and your correspondents can share theirs with you. Once you have a correspondentâ€™s public key you can begin sending encrypted emails to this person. Only she will be able to decrypt and read your emails, because she is the only person who has access to the matching private key.

Similarly, if you send a copy of your own public key to your email contacts and keep the matching private key secret, only you will be able to read encrypted messages from those contacts.

You may also attach digital signatures to your messages. The recipient of your message who has a genuine copy of your public key will be able to verify that the email comes from you, and that its content was not tampered with on the way. Similarly, if you have a correspondent's public key, you can verify the digital signatures on her messages.

**gpg4usb** lets you generate an encryption key pair, export public keys to be shared with other people, compose a text message, and encrypt it. You can either simply copy and paste the public key and/or encrypted message from **gpg4usb** to the body of your email, or save them as a text file to be sent later. Documents and files can be encrypted too. 

**Note**: Be mindful that the original, unencrypted versions of your documents and files may still reside on your computer, so both your correspondent and yourself must remember to remove them from computers when necessary.

**gpg4usb** lets you exchange keys and encrypted messages with other similar **GPG** or **PGP** programs.
