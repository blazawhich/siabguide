# Firefox Add-Ons

In the context of **Mozilla** products, an add-on is simply a lightweight software program which adds new features or extends existing functionality. As such, add-ons are sometimes referred to as *extensions*. For instance, the **NoScript** add-on extends **Firefox** functionality to block scripts from defined servers. 

A **plugin** is essentially a piece of software usually designed by a third party to enable the use of their software within **Firefox** browser. An example of a common plugin would be the **Flash** plugin designed to display **Adobe Flash** content within the **Firefox** browser window.

## Install Firefox Add-Ons

Downloading and installing **Mozilla Add-ons** is quick and simple. To begin downloading and installing different add-ons, perform the following steps: 

### Step 1

**Select Start > Mozilla Firefox** or **double-click** the **Firefox** desktop icon to open **Firefox**. 

### Step 2

**Type** [**https://addons.mozilla.org/**](https://addons.mozilla.org/) into the **Firefox** address bar, and then **press** *Enter* to activate the **Mozilla Add-ons for Firefox** site.

### Step 3

**Type** the name of the add-on into the **Mozilla** search field (the **Adblock Plus** add-on is used in this example) as follows:

*Figure 1: The Mozilla Firefox Add-ons Search bar displaying Adblock Plus* 

### Step 4

Either **click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/21.png)[Firefox img 18] or **press** *Enter* to display the following screen:

*Figure 2: The Search Results for Adblock Plus pane*

**Tip**: The green *Add to Firefox* button only appears when the cursor is placed within a specified add-on section. 

### Step 5

**Click** ![Add to Firefox](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/23.png)[Firefox img 20] to activate the following screens:

### Step 6

**Click** ![Allow](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/25.png)[Firefox img 22] to activate the following windows:

![Adblock Plus :: Search](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/26.png)[Firefox img 23]

### Step 7

**Click** ![Install Now](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/28.png)[Firefox img 25] after it becomes enabled, to begin installing the add-on; after the installation has been completed, the following screen will appear:

![Adblock plus :: Search - pop-up notification](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/29.png)[Firefox img 26]

*Figure 6: The Adblock plus :: Search :: Add-ons for Firefox - Mozilla Firefox with a pop-up notification*

**Tip**: Many add-ons and extensions currently require that **Firefox** be restarted to successfully install them. **Click** either ![Restart Now](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/30.png)[Firefox img 27] or ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/31.png)[Firefox img 28], to **select** the *Not Now* item if you prefer to restart **Firefox** later. 

### Step 8

**Select** *Add-ons* item in the *Tools* menu in the **Firefox** menu bar, to activate the following screen:

![Tools - Add-ons item selected](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/32.png)[Firefox img 29]

*Figure 7: The Tools menu with the Add-ons item selected*

*Figure 8: The Add-ons Manager tab displaying the newly installed Adblock Plus add-on*

**Important**: **Do not install add-ons from unknown sources.** Instead, always install add-ons from the [**https://addons.mozilla.org/**](https://addons.mozilla.org/) web site for improved security.

## Disable or Remove Firefox Add-Ons

The *Add-ons* tab displays all installed add-ons as shown in *Figure 8*. Any **Mozilla** add-on can be either temporarily disabled by **clicking** ![Disable](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/34.png)[Firefox img 31] or completely removed by **clicking** ![Remove](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/35.png)[Firefox img 32]. However, in some instances **Firefox** *must* be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Update Mozilla Add-ons

Every so often, the various add-ons designed for use must be updated to be compatible or current with the latest version of **Firefox**. Depending on your connection speed, you may choose to either update these add-ons automatically or manually. 

### Step 1

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/36.png)[Firefox img 33] to activate its associated menu, and then **select** *Check for updates* item to manually update your add-ons as shown in *Figure 9* below.

*Figure 9: The Add-ons Manager update button displaying its associated drop-down list*

### Step 2

Alternatively, **select** the *Update Add-ons Automatically* item to update your add-ons automatically as shown in *Figure 9 above*.

## Update Mozilla Plugins

Given that a few plugins may not automatically update themselves, users are strongly recommended to check for the latest updates of **Mozilla Plugins**. 

To manually check for updates of plugins, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** **https://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck** to activate the following site:

![Mozilla Firefox Plugin Check & Updates site](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/38.png)[Firefox img 35]

*Figure 10: The Mozilla Firefox Plugin Check & Updates site*

### Step 2

**Address** each plugin issue presented on the web page, indicated by the status on the button as follows:

- For plugins displaying ![Update Now](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/39.png)[Firefox img 36] we **strongly** recommend that you *immediately* update them by clicking this button, and follow its instruction page. (Alternatively, please follow the steps after this list of buttons to disable or remove obsolete plugins.) 

- For plugins displaying ![Research](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/45.png)[Firefox img 37], consider disabling or removing them unless the plugins are required and updated individually.

- For plugins displaying ![Up to Date](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/47.png)[Firefox img 38], review them individually to determine which are required, and disable or remove those which are unknown or unnecessary.

To **disable** an unknown plugin or one that is no longer required, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Select Tools > Add-ons** to activate the *Add-ons Manager* tab. 

### Step 2

**Click** ![Plugins](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/40.png)[Firefox img 39] to reveal a complete list of **Mozilla Firefox** plugins, identify the plugin you would like to disable, and then **click** ![Disable](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/34.png)[Firefox img 31].

To **remove a plugin** from your computer:

### Step 1

**Click Start > Control Panel**.

### Step 2

**Click** ![Programs - Uninstall](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/41.png)[Firefox img 40].

### Step 3

**Select** the relevant program from the window, and then **click** ![Remove](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/43.png)[Firefox img 40]. 

Repeat these steps until all the issues on the *Plugin Check & Updates* page are resolved. It is *absolutely essential* that you search for updates on a **monthly basis** at minimum. Plugins are constantly being improved and upgraded to deal with all manner of evolving security problems. 

**IMPORTANT**: **Adobe Flash** and **Oracle Java** are known to contain many security vulnerabilities that may let remote users assume control of your computer, and install spyware to access or monitor all your communication and data. It is **strongly** advised that you uninstall both of those programs from your computer(s), or at least disable their associated plugins in **Firefox**. For more information about how to disable or remove Java, please refer to [steps to disable Java for all browsers on your computer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) or [guide on how to uninstall Java from your computer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml).
