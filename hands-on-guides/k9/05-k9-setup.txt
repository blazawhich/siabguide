# Configure K9

## Step 1

When you first run **K-9** it asks you to set up a new account, **type** in your email address and password.

## Step 2

**Select** what type of account you have (IMAP/POP/Exchange). If unsure, **check** the email client on your computer.

## Step 3

Next are the incoming server settings. If unsure, refer to the email client on your computer for settings. Always **ensure** that the *security type* is set to either *SSL (always)* or *TLS (always)*. **Never** use the *none* option.

## Step 4

**K-9** will then connect to your mail server to check if your settings work. It might display a warning about the certificate of your secured connection. *Do not ignore this!* This is the only time you can verify that the certificate really belongs to your mail server. If you ignore this, you can not be sure if you are not subject to a *Man-in-the-Middle attack*, and your communications could be intercepted. You can see a SHA-1 fingerprint at the very end of the warning. Either **check** on your computer if the installed certificate from your mail server has the same fingerprint, or find a way to check your mail server's certificate directly from your provider. 

## Step 5

**K-9** asks you to configure your outgoing server settings. Again, **ensure** that *Security Type* is *SSL (always)* or *TLS (always)*. For all additional settings, **check** your computer's email client or the settings of your email provider.

## Step 6

**K-9** now asks you how often you want it to automatically poll for email. **Set** the option to *never*, which means you have to manually check for new mail.

## Step 7

The last pieces of information to provide are a nickname for the email account which will be displayed in **K-9** and to set up the name you wish to be displayed on all outgoing email.

## Step 8

To make sure the account is working in **K-9**, **send** yourself an email from your computer and download it from the **K-9** client.

We recommend that you use **K-9** only in addition to your computer's email client. Therefore it is important that when you download email with your Android phone, it does not delete the email on the server, since you want to receive the email later with your computer, too. By default, **K-9** is set up this way, but you may want to check it out and learn more about the settings which can be found in *accounts*, this can be reached by long tapping on the account you have just set up and selecting *account settings* from the menu. You may also wish to check the *fetching mail* and *sending mail* account option for settings that you may want to adjust.
