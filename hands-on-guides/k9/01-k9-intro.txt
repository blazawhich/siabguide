**K-9** is a free and open source email client for Android devices, that integrates seamlessly with **Android Privacy Guard**. 

**Android Privacy Guard** (APG) is a free and open source application for Android devices, created by [Thialfihar](http://www.thialfihar.org/), that lets you encrypt and decrypt single files or emails. It aims to be an OpenPGP implementation for Android, although not all features of OpenPGP are implemented yet. Its Public/Private key scheme lets you encrypt, decrypt and sign files and messages. You can also use it to encrypt single files with symmetric encryption, securing the files with a password. 

The use of these two tools allows for easy encrypting and decrypting of OpenPGP email messages.
