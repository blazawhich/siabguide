# Use K9 with APG

Before you can start sending and receiving encrypted email, you need to ensure that you have all your OpenPGP keys imported into APG.  To do this you need to copy your keys from your computer to your phone. 

Once copied over, complete the following steps to import your keys into APG.

## Step 1

**Open** **APG**. 

## Step 2

**Tap** the *menu* button, and **choose** *manage secret keys*.

**Press** the menu button again and select import keys

## Step 4

To import your public keys, **repeat** steps 2 and 3, choosing *manage public keys* at step 2.

## Step 5

Once your keypair(s) and your collection of public keys are imported into APG, **K-9** will give you the options to *sign* and *encrypt* messages when writing emails, or if you received encrypted mail, it will allow you to decrypt it.
