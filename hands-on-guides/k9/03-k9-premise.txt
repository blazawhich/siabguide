# Introduction to K9

- You need an email account.
- You need an OpenPGP key-pair and public keys of the people you wish to communicate with.
- You need to be familiar with the concept of public/private key encryption.
- You need to be online when setting up and using **K-9**.
- Due to the nature of data storage on smartphones, the private key you generate or import can not be deleted securely.
