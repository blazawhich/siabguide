Before you can start using **Pidgin** you must have an existing **IM** account, after which you will register that account to **Pidgin**. For instance, if you have an **Google Account**, you can use their **IM** service **GoogleTalk** with **Pidgin**. The log-in details of your existing **IM** account are used to register and access your account through **Pidgin**. 

**Note**: All users are encouraged to learn as much as possible about the privacy and security policies of their **Instant Messaging account provider**. 

**Pidgin** supports the following **IM** services: [**AIM**](http://dashboard.aim.com/aim), [**Bonjour**](http://www.apple.com/support/bonjour/), [**Gadu-Gadu**](http://komunikator.gadu-gadu.pl/), [**Google Talk**](http://www.google.com/talk/), **Groupwise**, [**ICQ**](http://www.icq.com), **IRC**, [**MSN**](http://www.msn.com/), [**MXit**](http://www.mxit.com/), [**MySpaceIM**](http://www.myspace.com/guide/im), [**SILC**](http://silcnet.org/), **SIMPLE**, [**Sametime**](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/lst/), [**Yahoo!**](http://messenger.yahoo.com/), **Zephyr** and any **IM** clients running the **XMPP** messaging protocol.

**Pidgin** does not permit communication between different **IM** services. For instance, if you are using **Pidgin** to access your **Google Talk** account, you will not be able to chat with a friend using an **ICQ** account. 

However, **Pidgin** can be configured to manage multiple accounts based on any of the supported messaging protocols. That is, you may simultaneously use both **Gmail** and **ICQ** accounts, and chat with correspondents using *either* of those specific services (which are supported by **Pidgin**). 

**Off-the-Record** (**OTR**) messaging is a plugin developed specifically for **Pidgin**. It offers the following privacy and security features: 

- **Authentication**: You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
- **Deniability**: After the chat session is finished, messages cannot be identified as originating from either your correspondent or you.
- **Encryption**: No one else can access and read your instant messages.
- **Perfect Forward Security**: If third party obtains your private keys, no previous conversations are compromised.

**Note**: **Pidgin** must be installed before the **OTR** plugin.
