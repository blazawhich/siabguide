# Add a Buddy in Pidgin

Adding buddies or correspondents in **Pidgin** involves adding and saving their contact information. In the example that follows, Terence will add Salima as his buddy.

To add a buddy to your **IM** account in **Pidgin**, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** *Buddies* to display its corresponding menu, and then **select** the *+ Add Buddy...* item as follows: 

![Buddy List menu with "Add Buddy..." selected](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-22.png)

*Figure 10: The Buddy List menu with the "Add Buddy..." item selected*

This will display the following screen: 

![Add Buddy window](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-23.png)

*Figure 11: The Add Buddy window*

### Step 2

If you have multiple accounts, **select** the account that corresponds to the same messaging service as your 'buddy'.  

**Note**: Both your buddy and yourself *must* be using the *same* messaging service, even if he/she is not using **Pidgin**. You cannot add an **ICQ** or **MSN** buddy to a **Google Talk** account. However, you can register and use multiple accounts based on these supported protocols in **Pidgin**. Whereby you may chat with one buddy using your **XMPP** account and with another using your **ICQ** or **MSN** accounts. 

### Step 3

**Type** in your buddy's email address in the *Username* field.  

The following step is optional.

### Step 4

**Type** in an *Alias* or nickname for your buddy in the *(Optional) Alias* field, so that your *Add Buddy* form resembles the following screen: 

![completed Add Buddy form](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-24.png)

*Figure 12: An example of a completed Add Buddy form*

### Step 5

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-19.png) to add your buddy.

**Note**: This will send a message to your buddy requesting approval or authorisation of your request, and will appear for your correspondent *Buddy List* as follows:  

![Authorize buddy request](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-25.png)

*Figure 13: The Authorize buddy request as it appears on Salima's Buddy List*

At this point, your buddy must perform the following step:

### Step 6

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-26.png) to add this person as your buddy and display her/him in your *Buddy List* as follows:

![Buddy List displaying buddy](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-27.png)

*Figure 14: Terence's Buddy List displaying Salima as his buddy*

**Note**: In the example above, Salima's *Alias* or nickname is displayed, adding yet another level of identity protection. 

![Buddy List displaying newly created buddy](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-30.png)

*Figure 15: Terence's Buddy List window displaying Salima's as his newly created buddy*

After you have added, authorised and confirmed your **Pidgin** chat buddy, he/she must now do the same with your **IM** contact information by repeating ### Steps 1 through 6** from their own account.

# Open an IM window in Pidgin

To open an **IM** chat window in **Pidgin**, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Right click** your buddy's name in the *Buddy List* to display a pop-up menu listing all the tasks you can perform as follows: 

![Buddy tasks menu](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-31.png) 

*Figure 16: The Buddy tasks menu*

### Step 2

**Select** the *IM* item from the pop-up menu to activate a typical chat window as follows: 

![A typical chat window in Pidgin](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-32.png) 

*Figure 17: A typical chat window in Pidgin*

Now you are almost ready to chat with your buddy using **Pidgin**. First, however, you must configure the **OTR** encryption to ensure that your chat sessions will be private and secure. Seen next page for this.

# Use OTR for Secure Instant Messaging with Pidgin

Both your correspondent and yourself must configure the **OTR** plugin before you can enable private and secure **Instant Messaging** (**IM**) sessions. **OTR** plugin will automatically detect when both parties have installed and properly configured the **OTR** plugin.

**Note**: If you request a private conversation with a friend who has neither installed nor configured **OTR**, it will automatically send a message explaining how they can obtain the **OTR** plugin.

## Configure the Pidgin-OTR Plugin

To enable the **OTR** plugin, perform the following steps: 

### Step 1

**Double click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-13.png) or **select** **Start > All Programs > Pidgin** to launch **Pidgin** and activate the *Buddy List* window (please refer to *Figure 1*).

### Step 2

**Open** the *Tools* menu, and then **select** the *Plugins* item as follows: 

![Buddy List window with Plugins item selected from Tools menu](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-40.png)

*Figure 1: The Buddy List window with the Plugins item selected from the Tools menu*

This will activate the *Plugins* window as follows:

### Step 2

**Scroll** down to the *Off-the-Record Messaging* option, then **click** its associated check box to enable it. 

![Pidgin Plugins window with Off-the-Record Messaging selected](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-41.png)

*Figure 2: The Pidgin Plugins window with Off-the-Record Messaging selected*

### Step 3

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-42.png) to begin configuring the *Off-the-Record Messaging* windows.

Basically, there are 3 steps involved in configuring **OTR** properly to effectively enable private and secure **IM** sessions and they are explained below: 

- **The First Step**: This involves generating a unique private key associated with your account, and displaying its fingerprint.

The next two steps involve securing the **IM** session and authenticating your buddies.

- **The Second Step**: This involves one party requesting a private and secure messaging session with another party currently on-line. 

- The **The Third Step** involves *authenticating* or verifying the identity of your **Pidgin** *buddy*. (**Note**: In **Pidgin**, a buddy is anyone you correspond with during **IM** sessions.) This process of verifying a buddy's identity is referred to as *authentication* in **Pidgin**. This means establishing that your buddy is *exactly* the person who he/she is claims to be.

## Generate a Private Key and Display its Fingerprint

Secure chat sessions in **Pidgin** are enabled by generating a *private key* for the relevant account. The *Off-the-Record* configuration window is divided into the *Config* and the *Known fingerprints* tabs. The *Config* tab is used to generate a *key* for each of your accounts and to set specific **OTR** options. The *Known fingerprints* tab contains a list of fingerprints of the keys of your contacts. You must possess a key for any buddy with whom you wish to chat privately. 

![Off-the-Record Messaging screen - Config tab](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-43.png)

*Figure 3: The Off-the-Record Messaging screen displaying the Config tab*

### Step 1

To optimise your privacy, **check** the *Enable private messaging*, *Automatically initiate private messaging* and *Don't log OTR conversations* options in the *Config tab* as shown in *Figure 3* above. 

### Step 2

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-44.png) to begin generating your secure key; a screen notifying you that a private key is being generated appears as follows:

![Generating private key confirmation box](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-45.png)

*Figure 4: The Generating private key confirmation box*

**Note**: Your buddy must perform the same steps for his/her own account. 

### Step 3

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-37.png) after the private key (which resembles the following), has been generated: 

![Fingerprint of the key generated by the OTR engine](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-46.png)

*Figure 5: An example of a fingerprint of the key generated by the OTR engine*

**Important**: You have now created a private key for your account on your computer. This will be used to encrypt your conversations so that nobody else can read them, even if they do manage to monitor your chat sessions. The fingerprint is a long sequence of letters and numbers used to identify the key for a particular account, as shown in *Figure 5* above. 

**Pidgin** automatically saves your fingerprint, and those of your buddies, on the computer you are using, so that you will not have to remember them. If you reinstall **Pidgin** or if you change to another computer you will either have to regenerate your key and re-authenticate your buddies, or you will need to move your key and fingerprints of your buddies to the new computer. To do this you will need to copy content of %APPDATA%\\.purple folder (~/.purple on Linux or Mac) to similar folder on new computer.

## Authenticate a Private Conversation

### Step 1

**Double-click** the account of a buddy who is currently on-line to begin a new **IM** conversation. If both of you have the **OTR** plugin installed and properly configured, you will notice that a new **OTR** button appears at the bottom right corner of your chat window. 

![Pidgin messaging window - OTR icon outlined in black](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-47.png)

*Figure 6: A Pidgin messaging window displaying the OTR icon outlined in black*

### Step 2

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-48.png) to activate its associated pop-up menu, and then **select** the *Start private conversation* item as follows: 

![pop-up menu with Start private conversation item selected](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-49.png)

*Figure 7: The pop-up menu with the Start private conversation item selected*

*Your **Pidgin IM** window will then resemble the following screen:*

![Pidgin IM window with Unverified button](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-50.png)

*Figure 8: The Pidgin IM window displaying the Unverified button*

**Note**: **Pidgin** automatically begin communicating with your buddy's **IM** program, and generating messages whenever you attempt to enable a private and secure chat session. As a result of this, the ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-48.png) **OTR** button changes to ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-51a.png), indicating that you are now able to have an encrypted conversation with your buddy. 

**Warning**! Although this conversation is now secure, the identity of your buddy has not been *verified* yet. Beware: Your buddy might actually be someone else *pretending* to be your buddy.

## Authenticate the Identity of Your Pidgin Buddy

You may use one of three methods of identification to authenticate your **Pidgin** buddy; you could use 1). a pre-arranged secret code phrase or word, 2). pose a question, the answer to which is only known to both of you or 3) manually verify the fingerprints of your key using a different method of communication.

### The Secret Code Phrase or Word Method ###

You can arrange a code phrase or word in advance, either by meeting each other in person or by using another communications medium (like a telephone, voice chat by [**Jitsi**](/en/jitsi) or a mobile phone text message). Once you both type in the same code phrase or word, your session will be authenticated. 

**Note**: The **OTR** secret code word recognition feature is case sensitive, that is, it can determine the difference between capital (A,B,C) letters and lower case (a,b,c) ones. Bear this in mind when inventing a secret code phrase or word!

### Step 1

**Click** the *OTR* button in the chat window, then **select** the *Authenticate Buddy* item as follows: 

![Unverified pop-up menu with Authenticate buddy item selected](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-52.png)

*Figure 9: The Unverified pop-up menu with the Authenticate buddy item selected*

This will activate the *Authenticate Buddy* window, prompting you to select an authentication method. 

### Step 2

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-53.png) and **select** *Shared Secret* as follows: 

![Authenticate buddy screen with drop-down list revealed](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-54.png)

*Figure 10: The Authenticate buddy screen with the drop-down list revealed* 

### Step 3

**Enter** the secret code word or phrase as follows:

![Shared Secret screen](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-55.png)

*Figure 11: The Shared Secret screen* 

### Step 4

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-56.png) to activate the following screen:

![Authenticate Buddy window for a fictitious correspondent](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-58.png)

*Figure 12: The Authenticate Buddy window for a fictitious correspondent*

**Note**: *At this time your buddy will see window shown on figure 13 at his/her end and will have to enter the same code word. If they match, your session will be
authenticated.*

![Authenticate Buddy window for a fictitious correspondent](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-57.png)

*Figure 13: The Authenticate Buddy window for a fictitious correspondent*

Once the session is authenticated, the *OTR* button will change to ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-51.png). Your session is now secure and you can be sure that you are really speaking with your buddy.

### The Question and Answer Method ###

Another method of authenticating each other, is the question and answer method. Create a question and an answer to it. After reading the question, your buddy must type in the *exact* answer, and if their answer matches yours, your identity will be automatically authenticated. 

### Step 1

**Click** the *OTR* menu in active message window to activate its associated pop-up menu, and then **select** *Authenticate Buddy* item (please refer to *Figure 9*).

![Pidgin chat window with OTR icon](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-50.png)

*Figure 14: A Pidgin chat window displaying the OTR icon*

An *Authenticate Buddy* window will pop up prompting you to choose the method for authentication. 

### Step 2

**Click** the drop-down menu and **select** the *Question and Answer* item as follows:  

![Authenticate buddy screen](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-60.png)

*Figure 15: The Authenticate buddy screen*

### Step 3

**Enter** a question and its corresponding answer. This question will be sent to your buddy. 

![Questions and Answer screen](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-61.png)

*Figure 16: The Questions and Answer screen*

If your buddy's answer matches yours, then your identities will have been mutually authenticated or verified, and both parties are who they claim to be! 

Once the session has been authenticated, the *OTR* button will change to ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-51.png). Your session will now be secure and you can be certain of your chat buddy's identity.

### Manual fingerprint verification ###

The third method of authenticating each other, is the fingerprint verification. In this method you need to exchange displayed fingerprints (see figure 17 below) for your buddy and yourself over another communication channel (like secure email or voice call). If exchanged fingerprints are the same you can select ***I have** verified that this is in fact the correct fingerprint* and  **Authenticate** the session.

![Manual fingerprint verification](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-79.png)

*Figure 17: The Manual fingerprint verification screen*

Notice that when you **Select > Buddy List > Tools > Plugins > Off The Record Messaging > Configure Plugin**, the *Known fingerprints* tab now displays your buddy's account, and a message that their identity has been verified. 

![Off-the-Record Messaging screen with Known Fingerprints tab](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-62.png)

*Figure 18: The Off-the-Record Messaging screen displaying the Known Fingerprints tab*

Congratulations! You may now chat privately. The next time you and your buddy chat (using the same computers), you should only have to request a secure connection (as on figure 7 above) and have your buddy accept it. Your session should already be authenticated.
