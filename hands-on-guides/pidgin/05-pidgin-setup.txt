# Overview of Account Registration and Setup Process

There are four basic steps in the **Pidgin** account registration and setup process; registering an existing **IM** account to **Pidgin**, adding a correspondent or *buddy*, getting your buddy to do the same, and lastly accessing the chat window for your first chat session.

Given that chat or **IM** sessions take place between two parties, the examples on this page describe how the various forms and windows appear to *both* buddies/correspondents (represented by two fictional characters, Salima and Terence) at different stages of the account registration and set up process. All examples are based on the **Riseup.net** IM service.

**Note**: Before you can start using **Pidgin**, you must already have an **Instant Messaging** (**IM**) account with one of the providers listed in *Figure 6* below. If you would like to create an **IM** account, we recommend using **Riseup** email account which can be later used for [XMPP communication](https://help.riseup.net/en/chat). Please refer to chapter [**RiseUp - Secure Email Service**](/en/riseup_main) for information and instructions on how to setup **Riseup** account. You can also use XMPP account providers listed in section [2.2 How to Add Accounts in Jitsi](/en/jitsi_account#2.2), like: [Jit.si](https://jitsi.org/Register/Register) or Google Account.

# Register Your Instant Messaging Account with Pidgin

To register your **IM** account to **Pidgin**, perform the following steps:

## Step 1

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-13.png) or **select Start > All Programs > Pidgin** to launch **Pidgin**. The first time you use **Pidgin**, the following screen will appear:

![Accounts confirmation window](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-14.png)

*Figure 4: The Accounts confirmation window*

## Step 2

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-15.png) to display a blank *Add Account* window as follows: 

![Add Account screen - Basic, Advanced and Proxy tabs](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-16.png) 

*Figure 5: The Add Account screen displaying Basic, Advanced and Proxy tabs*

## Step 3

**Click** the *Protocol* drop-down list to view the **IM** service protocols supported by **Pidgin** as follows:

*Figure 6: The Add Account window displaying a list of supported IM protocols*

## Step 4

**Select** the appropriate **IM** protocol.

**Note**: Different **IM** service providers will display their specific text fields for you to fill in. Some of them are automatically partly filled in. However, all services require that you to enter a username and a password.

## Step 5

**Type** in your email address (for example, [**terencethetester@riseup.net**](mailto:terencethetester@riseup.net)) in the *Username* field. 

## Step 6

**Type** in your password for this specific account in the *Password* field. 

## Step 7

**Type** a nickname you would like to be identified by in the *Local Alias* field. (This field is optional.) 

**Important**: To optimise your privacy and security, do *not* enable the *Remember password* option. It means that **Pidgin** will prompt you for your password whenever you log in to chat on-line. Doing this prevents imposters from logging in and pretending to be you, if you happen leave your computer unattended for some time. Also, remember to **select** the *Quit* item from the *Buddies* drop-down menu after finishing your chat session! 

A completed *Add Account* screen would resemble the following:

![completed Add Account form](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-18.png) 

*Figure 7: An example of a completed Add Account form*
 
## Step 8

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-19.png) to complete adding your account, and simultaneously display an updated *Accounts* the *Buddy List* screens as follows:

![updated Accounts window](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-20.png)      ![Buddy List in Active mode](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/pidgin-win-21.png)

*Figure 8: An updated Accounts window;*   *Figure 9: The Buddy List in Active mode*

After completing these steps, you are now ready to register your **Pidgin** buddies, by entering their contact information.
