## Step 2

The application will ask you if you want to copy the existing text message database on your device. It is recommended to **copy** your messages in order to have them encrypted, and **delete** them from the old location.

## Step 3

**Check** to make sure your old messages appear in the **TextSecure** app inbox.

## Step 4

**Delete** your messages from their previous location.

At this point you are ready to use **TextSecure** as your texting application. **Note:** If you do not wish to exchange encrypted text messages, you can still use **TextSecure** to securely *store* the messages you send and receive, meaning that should you lose your device, they will remain unreadable to anyone who should find it.
