# Flickr Privacy Settings

## Step 1

In order to access the Privacy & Permissions settings on **Flickr**, **login** to you **Flickr** account using **Mozilla Firefox** browser and **click** the icon in the top right of the screen and **choose** *Settings*. 

## Step 2

From the main *settings* page, select *Privacy & Permissions*.

## Step 3

By default, Flickr allows anyone to see your pictures. If you would like more privacy, **click** *edit* on the *Who can access your original image files* option and **choose** *Only you*. Then **click** *Save*.

## Step 4

By default, **Flickr** allows people who can access your content to share it more widely on sites such as Facebook or Twitter. This would mean that, in the case of sensitive images, they could easily fall into the wrong hands. In order for only you to decide how the images are shared, it is reccommended that you disable this option. To do so, **click** on *edit* beside *Allow others to share your stuff* and **select** *No, thanks*. Then **click** *Save*.

## Step 5

By default, **Flickr** allows any other member to tag you in photos. This could prove dangerous, for example, should someone add tag you in a photo of a protest or other kind of civil disobedience. Therefore, it's reccommended that you **select** *Only you* to be able to tag yourself in pictures.

## Step 6

By default, **Flickr** shares your **EXIF** data - that is, the metadata from your pictures such as the make and model of your camera, the location and time at which the photo was taken, etc. -- with other users. As this information can be sensitive, it is reccommended that you do not share it.

## Step 7

By default, **Flickr** makes your pictures and public profile accessible via search engines. For more privacy and control over who can access your information and pictures, it is reccommended that you **hide** your profile and pictures from public searches.

## Step 8

**New uploads**: Flickr's default settings promote as much sharing of information and interaction as possible when you upload new content. It is reccommended that you choose more private default options, such as: 

*  Disallowing others to immediately view, share or comment on your newly uploaded photos
*  Disallowing others to view the location data or your newly uploaded photos
*  Allowing only a restricted audience access to your newly uploaded photos

These settings can, of course, be changed on a per-upload basis, should you want to include EXIF data as evidence, for example.
