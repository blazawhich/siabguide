# Use Cryptonite for local file encryption

## Step 1

When opening **Cryptonite** you see a screen with three tabs on the top: *dropbox*, *local* and *expert*. We use the first feature, *local*, here. **Tap** on *local*.

*Figure 8: Options for use*

## Step 2

To create an encrypted volume, **tap** *Create local volume*. A message will appear as shown below, read it carefully then tap on **create volume**.

## Step 3

Choose amongst the different grades of encryption. *Standard* or *Paranoia* are our recommendations.

## Step 4

A file browser opens. Choose a folder which is used as the place for encryption. Remember which folder you choose! Instead you can create a new folder by clicking on ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-29.png) from the top right of the screen.

 ![Select folder](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-10.png)

*Figure 11: Select folder*

## Step 5

If you are creating a new folder, **type** the new folder name as shown below.

*Figure 12 and 13: How to create a new folder*

## Step 6

The new folder is created as shown below. **Click** on *Use current folder*.

 ![Select a folder](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-13.png)  ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-14.png)

*Figure 14 and 15: Select a folder*

## Step 7

A window will appear asking you to type in a password. **Enter** your password as shown below.

 ![Enter passphrase](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-15.png)  ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-16.png)

*Figure 16 and 17: Enter passphrase*

## Step 8

**Confirm** your password.

*Figure 18: Confirm your password*

Congratulations! you just have created an encrypted volume to securely store files.

# Upload files to the Cryptonite folder

## Step 1

Tap *decrypt local folder* and choose the folder you just selected before.

![Decryption options](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-20.png)  

*Figure 19: Decryption options*

## Step 2

**Browse** to the folder you created and **click** *Select current folder*

![Select a folder](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-18.png)

*Figure 20: Select a folder*

## Step 3

Enter the password you created earlier for this folder to access it.

![Enter your password](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-19.png)

*Figure 21: Enter your password*

## Step 3

**Tap** *upload file to this folder* to securely save one or more files to it.

![Folder selection](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-21.png)

*Figure 22: Folder selection*

## Step 4

A message will appear as shown below.

![Warning](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/cryptonite-and-22.png)

*Figure 23: Warning*

## Step 5

When done, **tap** *forget decryption*. This causes **Cryptonite** to delete a temporary file it has used for the previous operation and closes the folder in an encrypted state.

**Tip**: To check what you just did, **exit** **Cryptonite**, and navigate with your file browser to the encrypted volume you just created. You should find two files: one meta file that describes the encryption used (but not the password, of course) and one file that contains your encrypted file with a rather erratic file name.

**Note**: The original file is still in its original place. 

**Note**: Depending on your device, you may be able to create a local volume, too, that you can mount. This is much more comfortable since you can access it in its decrypted state with your file browser or any application.
