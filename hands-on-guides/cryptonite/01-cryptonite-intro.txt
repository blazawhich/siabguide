**Cryptonite** is a free and open source application for Android devices, created by the [Christoph Schmidthieber](https://code.google.com/p/cryptonite/). It is based on EncFS and TrueCrypt. You can browse, export and open EncFS-encrypted directories and files on your phone, and it supports it on your Dropbox, too. On rooted phones that support FUSE (e.g. CyanogenMod) you can also mount EncFS and TrueCrypt volumes. TrueCrypt is only available as a command-line version at this time. It can be used to store encrypted files.
