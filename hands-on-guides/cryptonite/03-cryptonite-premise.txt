# Introduction to Cryptonite

- **Cryptonite** is still under development and future versions might have more features.
- It is not advisable to use its *export* function to Dropbox, since Dropbox is not a privacy aware service.
- All TrueCrypt features are only available if you run Cyanogenmod firmware. Without it, you also can not mount and unmount encrypted folders, but only specific files.
