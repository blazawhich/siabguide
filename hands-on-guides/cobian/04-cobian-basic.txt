# Backup Your Directories and Files

In this section you will learn how to perform a simple backup or archive of a specified files and/or folders. **Cobian Backup** uses a *backup task* which can be configured to include a specified group of files and/or folders. A backup task can be set to run on a specified day and time.

To create a new backup task, perform the following step:

### Step 1

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/11.png)[Cobian img 11] to create a new backup task, and activate the *New task* window as follows:

![New task pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/12.png)[Cobian img 12]

*Figure 2: The New task pane*

The left sidebar lists a number of tabs and their associated screens - used to set different backup options and parameters - are displayed in the pane at right. All the options in the *General* tab are described below:

## Option Descriptions

*Task Name*: This *Task Name* text field lets you enter a name for the backup task. Use a name that identifies the nature of the backup. For example, if the backup is going to contain video files, you could name it *Video Backup*.

*Disabled*: This option *must* be left unchecked. 

**Warning**: Enabling the *Disabled* option will override the rest of the options, and prevent the backup task from running.

*Include Subdirectories*: This option lets you include all the subdirectories/folders within a selected directory/folder for the backup task. This is an efficient method for backing up a large number of folders and/or files. As an example, if you select the *My Documents* folder and check this option, then all files and folders in *My Documents* will be included in the backup task.

*Create separated backups using timestamps*: This option lets you specify that the date and time of the backup task will be automatically included in the folder name containing your backup file. This is a good idea because it means that you will easily be able to identify when the backup was performed.

*Use file attribute logic*: This option is only relevant when you choose to perform an incremental or differential backup (see below). File attributes contain information about the file.

**Note**: The following option is only available for **Windows OS** versions more recent than *and* including **Windows XP**.

*Use Volume Shadow Copy*: This option lets you backup files which are locked.

**Cobian Backup** verifies this information to determine whether there has been a change in the source file from the last time a backup was performed. If you then run an *Differential* or *Incremental* backup, the file will be updated. 

**Note**: You will only be able to run a full or 'dummy backup' if you *disable this option* (the dummy backup option is explained below).

## Backup Type Descriptions

*Full*: This option means that *every* single file in the source location will be copied to your backup directory. If you have enabled the *Create separated backups using timestamp* option, you will have several copies of the same source (identified by the time and date of the backup in the folder title). Otherwise, **Cobian Backup** will overwrite the previous version (if any).

*Incremental*: This option means the program will verify if the files selected for backup have been changed since the last backup was performed. If there has been no change, it will be skipped over during the backup process, saving backup time. The *Use file attribute logic* option needs to be checked in order to perform this backup.

*Differential*: The program will check if the source has been changed from the last **full** backup. If there is no need to copy that file, it will be skipped, saving backup time. If you have run a full backup before on the same set of files, then you can continue backing it up, using the Differential method.

*Dummy task*: You can use this option to get your computer to run or shut down programs at certain times. This is a more advanced option which is not really relevant to our basic backup procedure.

### Step 2

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/13.png)[Cobian img 13] to confirm your search options and parameters for your backup task.

## Create a Backup File

To begin creating a backup file, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** ![Files](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/14.png)[Cobian img 14] in the left sidebar of the *New task* window to display a *blank* version of the following screen:

![New task window displaying Source and Destination](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/15.png)[Cobian img 15]

*Figure 3: The New task (MyBackup) window displaying the Source and Destination panes*

### Step 2

**Select** the files you want to back up. (In *Figure 3* above, the *My Documents* folder is selected.)

### Step 3

**Click** ![Add](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/16.png)[Cobian img 16] in the *Source* pane to activate the following menu:

![Add button](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/17.png)[Cobian img 17]

*Figure 4: The Source pane - Add button menu*

### Step 4

**Select** *Directory* if you want to back up an entire directory, and *Files* to back up individual files. To specify individual files or directories to be backed up, select *Manually*, and type in the file path or directory for your backup. 

**Note**: You can add as many files or directories as you like. If you wish to back up files currently on your **FTP** server, choose the *FTP site* option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).

When you have selected the files and/or folders, they will appear in the *Source* area. As you can see in *Figure 3* above, the *My Documents* folder is displayed there, meaning this folder will now be included in the backup task.

The *Destination* pane specifies where the backup will be stored.

### Step 5

**Click** ![Add](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/16.png)[Cobian img 16] in the *Destination pane* to activate the following menu:

![Add button](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/18.png)[Cobian img 18]

*Figure 5: The Destination pane - Add button menu*

### Step 6

**Select** *Directory* to open a browser window where you select the destination folder for your backup file.

**Note**: If you want to create several versions of the backup file, you may specify several folders here. If you selected the *Manually* option, you must type in the full path to the folder where you want to keep the backup. To use a remote Internet server to store your archive, **select** the *FTP site* option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).

The screen should now resemble the example above example with file(s) and/or folder(s) in the source area and folder(s) in the destination area. However, don't click *OK* just yet! You still need to set a schedule for your backup.

## How to Schedule Your Backup Task

For your automatic backup to work, you need to fill in the *Schedule* section. This section lets you specify when you want the backup to be performed.

To set the schedule options, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Select** ![Schedule](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/19.png)[Cobian img 19] from the left sidebar, to activate the following pane:

![Properties for myBackup with Schedule type](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/20.png)[Cobian img 20]

*Figure 6: The Properties for myBackup displaying the Schedule type pane*

The *Schedule type* options are listed in the drop-down menu, and described below:

*Once*: The backup will be done once only at the date and time specified in the *Date/Time* area.

*Daily*: The backup will be done every day at the time specified in the *Date/Time* area.

*Weekly*: The backup will be done on the days of the week selected. In the example above, the backup will be done on Fridays. You may select other days also. The backup will be done on all days selected at the time specified in the *Date/Time* area.

*Monthly*: The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box at the time specified in the *Date/Time* area.

*Yearly*: The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box, during the month specified, and at the time specified in the *Date/Time* area.

*Timer*: The backup will be done repeatedly at intervals specified in the Timer text box in the *Date/Time* area.

*Manually*: You will have to run the backup yourself from the main program window.

### Step 2

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/13.png)[Cobian img 13] to confirm the options and settings for the backup schedule as follows:

![New task window with configured Schedule type](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/21.png)[Cobian img 21]

*Figure 7: The New task window displaying a configured Schedule type pane*

Once you have decided on a backup schedule, you have completed the final step. The backup will now run on the folders specified according to the schedule you have chosen.

# Compress and Decompress Your Files

## Compress Your Backup File

### Step 1

**Create** a backup task as documented in section [**2.3 How to Create a Backup File**](https://securityinabox.org/cobian_howtobackup#2.2)[Cobian Howto #2.2] containing the backup files you want to archive.

### Step 2

**Select** ![Archive](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/22.png)[Cobian img 22] from the left sidebar to activate the *New task* screen as follows:

![New task screen with Compression and Strong Encryption](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/23.png)[Cobian img 23]

*Figure 1: The New task screen displaying the Compression and Strong Encryption panes*

The **Compression** pane is used to specify the method for compressing your backup.

**Note**: Compression is used to reduce the amount of space for file storage. If you have a bunch of old files that you use only occasionally, but you still want to keep, it would make sense to store them in a format where they take up as little space as possible. Compression works by removing a lot of unnecessary coding out of your documents, while leaving important information intact. Compression does not damage your original data. The files are not viewable when compressed. The process must be reversed and your files 'decompressed' when you want to view the files again.

The three sub-options in the *Compression type* drop-down list are:

*No Compression*: This option does not perform any compression, as you would expect.

*Zip Compression*: This option is the standard compression technique for **Windows** systems, and the most convenient. Archives once created can be opened with standard Windows tools (or you can download the [**ZipGenius**](http://www.zipgenius.it/) program to access them). 

Selecting a compression type listed automatically enables the *Split options* section, and its corresponding drop-down list.

The *Split options* apply to storage on removable media, for example CDs, DVDs, floppy disks and USB memory sticks. The various split options will subdivide the archive into sizes that will fit onto your storage device of choice. 

Example: 
Let's say that you are archiving a large number of files, and you want to burn them to a CD. However, your archive size turns out to be larger than 700MB (the size of a CD). The splitting function will split the archive into pieces smaller than or equal to 700MB, which you can then burn onto your CDs. If you are planning to back up onto your computer's hard disk, or the files that you want to back up are smaller than the device you plan to store them on, you can skip this section.

The following options are available to you when you click on the *Split options* drop-down list. Your choice will depend on the type of removable storage device available to you.

![Split Options drop-down list](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/24.png)[Cobian img 24]

*Figure 2: The Split Options drop-down list*

- 3,5" - Floppy disk. This option is big enough to perform backup of a small number of documents
- Zip - Zip Disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a special Zip Drive in your computer and the custom-made disks
- CD-R - CD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a CD Writer in your computer and a CD writing program (see [**DeepBurner Free** ](http://www.deepburner.com/) version or other [**disk burning tools**](http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/dvdcdburning.shtml)).
- DVD - DVD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a DVD Writer in your computer and a DVD writing program (see [**DeepBurner Free** ](http://www.deepburner.com/) version or other [**disk burning tools**](http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/dvdcdburning.shtml)). 

If you are backing up onto several USB memory sticks you may want to set a custom size.

To do this, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Select** the *Custom size* (bytes) option, then <b>type</b> the size of the archive in bytes into the text field as follows:

![Custom size text field](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/25.png)[Cobian img 25]

*Figure 10: The Custom size text field*

To give you an idea of sizes

- 1KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes - a one-page text document made in Open Office is approximately 20kb
- 1MB (megabyte) = 1024 KB - a photo taken on a digital camera is usually between 1 - 3 MB
- 1GB (gigabyte) = 1024 MB - approximately half hour of a DVD quality movie 

**Note:** When choosing a custom size to split your backup for a CD or DVD disk, Cobian Backup will not copy the backup to your removable device automatically. Rather, it will create your archive in those files on the computer and you will need to burn them to the CD or DVD disk yourself.

*Password Protect*: This option lets you enter a password to protect the archive. Simply type, then re-type a password into the two boxes provided. When you try to decompress the archive, you will be asked for the password before the task commences.

**Note**: If you want to secure your archive, you should think about using another method than a password. **Cobian Backup** lets you encrypt your archive. This will be covered in section, [**4. How to encrypt the Backup File**](https://securityinabox.org/cobian_encrypt)[Cobian Encrypt]. Alternatively, you may also refer to the [**Truecrypt Hands-on Guide**](https://securityinabox.org/truecrypt_main)[Truecrypt Main] to find out how to create an encrypted storage space on your computer or removable device.

*Comment*: This option lets you write something descriptive about the archive, but it is not a requirement.

## Decompress Your Backup File

To decompress your backup, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Select > Tools > Decompressor** as shown below;

![Tools menu with Decompressor option](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/26.png)[Cobian img 26]

*Figure 3: The Tools menu displaying the Decompressor option*

The **Decompressor** window appears as follows:

![Cobian 10 Backup - Decompressor window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/27.png)[Cobian img 27]

*Figure 4: The Cobian 10 Backup - Decompressor window*

### Step 2

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/28.png)[Cobian img 28] to open a browse window to enable you to select the archive you want to decompress.

### Step 3

**Select** the archive (*.zip* or *.7x* file) and then **click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/13.png)[Cobian img 13].

### Step 4

**Select** a directory into which you will unpack (output) the archived file.

### Step 5

**Click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/29.png)[Cobian img 29] to open another window that lets you choose the folder in which to unpack the archive.

### Step 6

**Select** a folder, and then **click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/13.png)[Cobian img 13].

Use **Windows Explorer** to view the files that go to that folder.

# Encrypt and Decrypt Your Backup File

Encryption may be a necessity for those wishing to keep their backup secure from unauthorised access.

Encryption is the process of encoding, or scrambling, data in such a way that it appears unintelligible to anyone who does not have the specific key needed to decode the message. For more information on encryption, please refer to **How-to Booklet** chapter [**4.How to protect the sensitive files on your computer**](https://securityinabox.org/chapter-4)[Secure Storage]

## How to Encrypt Your Backup File

The *Strong encryption* pane is used to specify the encryption method to be used.

### Step 1

**Click** the *Encryption type* drop-down box to activate its list of different encryption methods as follows:

![Encryption type drop-down list](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/30.png)[Cobian img 30]

*Figure 1: The Encryption type drop-down list*

To keep things simple, we recommend that you choose from either the *Blowfish* or the *Rijndael* (128 bits) methods. These will provide excellent security for your archive, and let you access the encrypted data with a chosen password.

### Step 2

**Select** the *Encryption* type you want to use.

**Note**: *Rijndael* and *Blowfish* both offer approximately the same level of security. *DES* is weaker but the encryption process is faster.

### Step 3

**Type** and **re-type** the password into the two boxes provided as below.

![Encryption type and Passphrase text fields](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/31.png)[Cobian img 31]

*Figure 2: The Encryption type and Passphrase text fields*

The strength of the password is indicated by the bar marked 'Passphrase quality'. The further the bar moves to the right, the stronger the passphrase. Refer to the **How-to Booklet** chapter [**3.How to Create and Maintain Secure Passwords**](https://securityinabox.org/chapter-3)[Secure Passwords] and the [**KeePass**](https://securityinabox.org/en/keepass_main)[KeePass Main] Hands-on guide for instructions on how to create and store secure passphrases (or passwords).

### Step 4

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/13.png)[Cobian img 13].

## Decrypt Your Backup File

Decrypting your backup file is easy and quick. To decrypt your backup file, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Select > Tools > Decrypter and Keys** as shown below:

![Tools menu with Decrypter and Keys item selected](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/32.png)[Cobian img 32]

*Figure 3: The Tools menu with Decrypter and Keys item selected*

*This will activate the Decrypter and Keys window as follows:*

![Cobian Backup 10 Decrypter and Keys](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/33.png)[Cobian img 33]

*Figure 4: The Cobian Backup 10 Decrypter and Keys window*

### Step 2

**Click** ![Select](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/34.png)[Cobian img 34] to select the archive you want to decrypt.

### Step 3

**Click** ![Destination](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/35.png)[Cobian img 35] to select the folder in which to store the decrypted archive.

### Step 4

**Select** the same encryption type you selected in section [**4.1 How to Encrypt Your Backup File**](https://securityinabox.org/chapter_4_1)[Encrypting Information], in the *Methods* drop-down list.

![New Methods drop-down list](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/36.png)[Cobian img 36]

*Figure 5: The New Methods drop-down list*

### Step 4

**Select** the appropriate encryption method (the one you used to encrypt your backup file).

### Step 5

**Type** your passphrase into the *Passphrase* text fields.

### Step 6

**Click** ![Decrypt](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/cobian-en/37.png)[Cobian img 37].

The file(s) will be decrypted to the location that you specified. If the files were also compressed, you will need to decompress them as outlined in section  [**3.1 How to Decompress Your Backup**](https://securityinabox.org/cobian_compress#3.1)[Cobian Decompress].
