# How to Install Comodo

Installing **COMODO Firewall** is a relatively easy and quick procedure, divided into two stages: the first involves manually disabling the **Windows Firewall**, and the second is the actual **COMODO Firewall** software installation. 

Ideally, you should only use one firewall program for your computer system at any given time. If you are currently using another firewall on your computer, it must be uninstalled before you install **COMODO Firewall**, so as to eliminate potential software conflicts between similar types of programs.

## Disable the Windows Firewall

To disable the **Windows Firewall** program, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Select Start > Control Panel > Windows Firewall** to activate the **Windows Firewall** screen. 

### Step 2

**Check** the *Off (not recommended)* option to disable the **Windows Firewall** as shown in *Figure 1* below: 

![Windows Firewall with Off option enabled](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/01.png)[Comodo img 01]

*Figure 1. The Windows Firewall with the Off option enabled*

### Step 3

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/02.png)[Comodo img 02] to complete disabling the *Windows Firewall*.

## Install Comodo Firewall

**Note**: **COMODO Firewall** does not automatically uninstall older or previously existing versions of its software. It must be manually uninstalled it before you begin installing the latest version.

To begin installing **COMODO Firewall**, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Double click** ![installer](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/03.png)[Comodo img 03] to begin the installation process. The *Open File - Security Warning* dialog box may appear. If it does, **click** ![Run](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/04.png)[Comodo img 04] to activate the following confirmation dialog box:

![Select the language confirmation dialog box](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/05.png)[Comodo img 05]

*Figure 2: The Select the language confirmation dialog box*

### Step 2

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/06.png)[Comodo img 06] to activate the *End User License Agreement*. Please read the *End User License Agreement* before proceeding with the rest of the installation process, and then **click** ![I accept](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/07.png)[Comodo img 07] to activate the *Free Registration* screen. 

### Step 3

Do **not** enter your email address into the *Enter your email address (optional)* text field; simply **click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/09.png)[Comodo img 08] to activate the *Extracting the Packages* screen.

After the extraction process has been completed, the *Firewall Setup Destination Folder* appears.  

### Step 4

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/09.png)[Comodo img 08] to accept the default path and activate the *Firewall security level selection* screen, and then check the *Firewall Only* option as follows: 

![Firewall Security level selection screen](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/11.png)[Comodo img 09]

*Figure 3: The Firewall Security level selection screen*

**Definition of Firewall Security Level Options**

Each firewall security level option caters to users of different levels. Each option balances different kinds of protection with complexity of usage, as well as the number of security alerts you may receive. A brief description of each security level is provided as follows: 

**Firewall Only** mode: This option lets you run **COMODO Firewall** without the *Defense +* feature enabled. It readily identifies popular applications which are relatively safe (like web browsers and email clients), reducing the number of security alerts you may receive. It offers general explanations of why a particular alert screen has appeared. In addition, the actions to be undertaken are relatively simple. 

**Firewall with Optimum Proactive Defense** mode: This option combines the solid protection of the *Firewall Only* mode with the *Defense+* feature enabled. *Defense+* offers active protection against malware designed to circumvent different firewalls. The *COMODO Firewall Alerts* offer more in-depth explanations of why a certain application or request is being blocked, and you have the option of partially isolating or 'sandboxing' a suspicious file or program.

**Firewall with Maximum Proactive Defense** mode: This option combines the security of the *Firewall with Optimum Proactive Defense* option with 'anti-leak' protection against more 'passive' security threats, for instance details about open ports on your computer being sent over the Internet. The sandbox feature is fully automated. 

### Step 6

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/09.png)[Comodo img 08] to activate the *COMODO Secure DNS Configuration* screen, with the *I would like to use COMODO Secure DNS Servers* option enabled as follows:

![COMODO Secure DNS Configuration](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/12.png)[Comodo img 10]

*Figure 4: The COMODO Secure DNS Configuration screen*

**Important**: Although no **Domain Name System** (**DNS**) server is ever completely secure, the advantages of using the **COMODO Secure DNS Servers** outweigh the disadvantages. It offers additional protection from *pharming* and *phishing*, which are two popular methods used by malicious forces to 'hijack' or redirect your computer to a dangerous or hostile site. **COMODO Secure DNS Servers** may also protect you from government interference, while being easy to set up during the installation process, and by facilitating safer access to web sites which are registered with **COMODO**. For instance, accidentally typing in the wrong URL will activate a message from the **COMODO Secure DNS Servers** resembling the following:

![example of COMODO Secure DNS Server notification](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/126.png)[Comodo img 11]

*Figure 5: A typical example of a COMODO Secure DNS Server notification*

### Step 7

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/09.png)[Comodo img 08] to activate the *Ready to Install COMODO Firewall* screen, and then **click** ![Install](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/13.png)[Comodo img 12] to begin the installation process, and activate the *Installing COMODO Firewall* screen. After the installation process has been completed, it will activate the *Completed the COMODO Firewall Setup Wizard* screen.

### Step 8

**Click** ![Finish](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/14.png)[Comodo img 13] to activate the *Done* confirmation screen, and then **click** ![Finish](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/14.png)[Comodo img 13] to activate the following confirmation dialog box:

![Firewall Installer confirmation dialog box](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/15.png)[Comodo img 14]

*Figure 6: The Firewall Installer confirmation dialog box*

### Step 9

**Click** ![Yes](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/16.png)[Comodo img 15] to restart your computer, and complete the **COMODO Firewall** installation procedure.

After your computer restarts itself, the The *New Private Network Detected!* screen appears as follows: 

![New Private Network Detected](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/17.png)[Comodo img 16]

*Figure 7: The COMODO Firewall New Private Network Detected! screen*

**Tip**: If you are working in a LAN environment, simply check the *I would like to be fully accessible to other PCs in this network* option to enable file/folder/printer and/or Internet connection sharing.

### Step 10

Either **type** in a name in the *Give a name to this network for your network* text field or simply accept the default name offered as shown in *Figure 7* above. Leave the options listed under *Step 2 - Decide if you want to trust the other PCs in this network* unchecked, and then **click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/06.png)[Comodo img 06] to complete the installation. 

The **COMODO Firewall** desktop icon and the **COMODO Firewall** connectivity icon simultaneously appear with *figure 7*. Before you connect to the Internet, the connectivity icon appears in the *System Tray* as follows:

![COMODO Firewall connectivity icon outlined in black in System Tray](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/18.png)[Comodo img 17]

*Figure 8: The COMODO Firewall connectivity icon outlined in black in the System Tray*

Going online or launching on-line related programs (for instance, web browsers) will trigger a series of light orange downwards-pointing arrowheads and/or light green upwards-pointing arrowheads, indicating incoming and outgoing Internet connection requests, and are depicted as follows: 

![COMODO Firewall connectivity icon in action](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/comodo-en/19.png)[Comodo img 18]

*Figure 9: The COMODO Firewall connectivity icon in action*
