# Install CCleaner

As described in detail in the **How-to Booklet** chapter [**6. How to Destroy Sensitive Information**](/chapter-6), the **Microsoft Windows** standard file deletion methods do not erase the actual data from the disk (even when you have emptied the *Recycle Bin*). This also applies to temporary files. To delete them permanently (that is, to *wipe* them) from the hard disk, the files must be overwritten with random data. **CCleaner** must be configured to overwrite any deleted files in order to securely delete them, as it will not do so in default mode. **CCleaner** can also securely delete old information by wiping any free disk space  (please refer to section **5.3 How to Wipe Free Disk Space Using CCleaner**).
