# Advanced features of CCleaner

**CCleaner's** *Uninstall* and *Startup* features could improve the overall efficiency of your system. They are described below, along with the steps required to permanently delete (or *wipe*) free space on a specified drive.

## How to Uninstall Programs Using CCleaner

**Important**: Make sure the program to be deleted or uninstalled is not essential to the proper functioning of your computer system before you begin doing so.

By deleting unused or unwanted previously installed software before running **CCleaner**, you may also remove their temporary files and folders. This may reduce the number of temporary files and folders to be deleted, as well as the length of time for the cleaning process.  

The **CCleaner** *Uninstall* feature is the equivalent of the **Uninstall a program** feature found in **Control Panel**. The *Uninstall* feature lists the programs more clearly and quickly.

To begin uninstalling obsolete programs, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

Either **click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/13.png)[Ccleaner img 12] or **select Start > Programs > CCleaner** to activate the *Piriform CCleaner* console.

### Step 2

**Click** ![Tools](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/50.png)[Ccleaner img 49] and then **click** ![Uninstall](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/51.png)[Ccleaner img 50] to activate the following screen:

*Figure 1: The Tools option displaying the Uninstall pane*

**Note**: The buttons on the right of the *Programs to Remove* list are only enabled after a program has been selected for removal.

### Step 3

**Select** a program from the *Programs to Remove* list, and then **click** ![Uninstall](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/53.png)[Ccleaner img 52] to uninstall the selected program.

**Tip**: Advanced or experienced users will find the *Rename* and *Delete* features useful in keeping the existence of certain software private. Either feature ensures only you know about the existence of this program, keeping it safe from hostile or malicious parties which may list installed programs.

### Step 4

**Click** ![Rename](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/54.png)[Ccleaner img 53] to rename that program. Alternatively, **click** ![Delete](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/55.png)[Ccleaner img 54] to delete a program from that list, but *without* actually uninstalling it.

## How to Disable Auto-Start Programs in CCleaner

An auto-start program is configured to automatically start itself whenever you turn your computer on. Auto-start programs may start making demands on finite system resources, and slow down your computer at start-up time. 

### Step 2

**Click** ![Tools](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/50.png)[Ccleaner img 49] and then **click** ![Startup](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/56.png)[Ccleaner img 55] to activate the following screen:

![Tools option with Startup pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/57.png)[Ccleaner img 56]

*Figure 2: Tools option - Startup pane*

### Step 3

**Select** a program from those listed in the *Startup* pane and then **click** ![Disable](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/58.png)[Ccleaner img 57] to disable the program so it does not automatically start running when you turn on your computer.

## How to Wipe Free Disk Space Using CCleaner

In the **Windows** operating system, deleting a file merely removes a reference to that file, but may not remove its actual data. Although the area of that drive will eventually be overwritten with new files over time, a knowledgeable individual could rebuild either all or sections of that file. However, you can prevent this from happening by wiping the free space on your hard disk. **CCleaner** also lets you wipe the **Master File Table**.

The **Master File Table (MFT)** is an index of all file names, their locations, and other information. When **Microsoft Windows** deletes a file it only marks the index entry for that file as deleted for reasons of efficiency. The **MFT** entry for the file and the content of the file continue to reside on the hard disk.

**Note**: Performing a disk and **Master File Table** wipe consumes a considerable amount of time, and the amount of time required depends on the number of passes set.

To set the drive you would like to wipe, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Click** ![Tools](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/61.png)[Ccleaner img 58] and then **click** ![Drive Wiper](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/62.png)[Ccleaner img 59] to activate the *Drive Wiper* pane. 

### Step 2

**Click** the *Wipe* ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/04.png)[Ccleaner img 60] to activate its drop-down list, and then **select**  either the *Free Space* or the *Entire drive (All data will be erased)* item, and then **select** ![Advanced Overwrite](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/59.png)[Ccleaner img 61] from the *Security* drop-down list.

**Warning**: Only select the *Entire drive (All data will be erased)* item if you are *completely* certain that you want your documents, files and folders *and* free space erased.

### Step 3

**Click** the check box associated with the drive to be erased, and enable the ![Wipe](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/64.png)[Ccleaner img 62]; your window should now resemble the following:

![Drive Wiper pane with the relevant options enabled](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/65.png)[Ccleaner img 63]

### Step 4

**Click** ![Wipe](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/64.png)[Ccleaner img 62] to begin wiping your selected drive(s).
