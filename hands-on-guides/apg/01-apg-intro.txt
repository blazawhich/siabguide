**Android Privacy Guard** (APG) is a free and open source application for Android devices, created by [Thialfiar](http://www.thialfihar.org/), that lets you encrypt and decrypt single files or emails. It aims provide **OpenPGP** encryption for Android devices, although not all features of OpenPGP are implemented yet. Its public/private key scheme lets you encrypt, decrypt and sign files and messages. You can also use it without any public/private key pair to encrypt single files with asymmetric encryption, securing the files with a password or passphrase. For email encryption we recommend to use it in combination with **K9**, an Android email client, for which there is also a [Hands on Guide](/en/k9_apg_main).
