# Introduction to APG

- **APG** integrates with the k9 Email client for android and makes email encryption a smooth affair. But first, you need to know how email encryption works. This is explained in Chapter [**7.4.Advanced Email Security**](https://siabdev.ngoinabox.org/en/chapter_7_4).
- **APG** can also be used to encrypt and decrypt files locally on your device with either a passphrase or public/private keypair.
