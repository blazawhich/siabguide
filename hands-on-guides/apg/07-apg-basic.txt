# Use APG to encrypt and decrypt files

## Step 1

After opening **APG**, **press** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/apg-and-01.png).

## Step 2

**Choose** the file to encrypt by pressing the folder symbol and select the file from the file manager.

## Step 3

If you want to have the original file deleted after it has been encrypted, **check** *Delete after encryption*. This is recommended in most cases.

## Step 4

In the lower part of the window you can choose between two encryption methods: Public Key encryption or Passphrase (by tapping on the arrows left or right). If you do not have a Public/Private key pair and are not familiar with Public/Private key schemes, choose *Pass phrase*.

## Step 5

**Type** a passphrase and repeat it. For secure passphrases, see How-to Booklet Chapter [**3. How to create and maintain secure passwords**](/en/chapter-3).

## Step 6

**Press** *Encrypt*

## Step 7

The next window will ask you to give a name to the encrypted file. If you press *OK* with out making any other changes; then the encrypted file is saved in the **APG** folder with the original file name and a ".gpg" extension. **Important:** if you change the name of the file, make sure it ends with ".gpg"

## Step 8

The device will begin to encrypt the selected file. Depending on the size of the file, this may take some time.

## Step 9

To **decrypt**, **press** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/apg-and-04.png)

## Step 10

**Choose** which file to decrypt. You may wish to choose *delete after decryption* if you want the original, unencrypted file to be deleted.

## Step 11

A window will appear asking for your passphrase: **type** it in as prompted.

![Enter passphrase](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/apg-and-06.png)

*Figure 4: Enter passphrase*

## Step 12

Another window will ask where to store the decrypted file and under which name. The default is again the **APG** folder.

## Step 13

The device will begin to decrypt the selected file. Depending on the size of the file, this may take some time.
