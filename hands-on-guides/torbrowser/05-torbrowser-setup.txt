# Configure the Tor Browser

## How to Connect to the Tor Network

The first time that you start the **Tor Browser** you will be prompted to choose how it will access the Internet:

- [Direct Access](https://securityinabox.org/tor_anonymitynetwork#3.1.1)[Tor Direct Access]:  This option should be selected if your access to the Internet is not restricted and if the use of **Tor** **is not** blocked, banned or monitored where you are.

- [Restricted Access](https://securityinabox.org/tor_anonymitynetwork#3.1.2)[Tor Restricted Access]: This option should be selected if your access to the internet is restricted or if the use of **Tor** **is** blocked, banned or monitored where you are.

These settings can be changed at any stage from within the **Tor Browser** without having to re-install the software. This may need to be done if situations in your location change or if you are visiting a different country.

Any subsequent time that you start the **Tor Browser** it will connect you to the **Tor** network with no additional configuration required.

## Connect to the Tor Network - Direct Access

To configure the **Tor Browser** to access the **Tor** network directly, perform the following steps:

### Step 1

**Navigate** to the *Tor Browser* folder, and then **double click** ![Start Tor Browser.exe](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/010.png)[TorBrowser img 08] to activate the following screen:

![Tor Network Settings](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/012.png)[TorBrowser img 10]

*Figure 1: The Tor Network Settings panel*


### Step 2

**Click** the ![Configure](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/013.png)[TorBrowser img 11] button, which will open the **Tor Status** window that shows you the progress as the software connects to the **Tor Network**.

![Tor Status windows - connection progress](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/014.png)[TorBrowser img 12]

*Figure 2: The Tor Status windows, showing the connection progress*

A few moments later, the **Tor Browser** will activate a new browser window displaying the following screen:

![Tor Browser; successfully connected to the Tor network](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/015.png)[TorBrowser img 13]

*Figure 3: Tor Browser; successfully connected to the Tor network*

You can now browse the web with the protection of the *Tor network*.

**Note**: Every time you launch the **Tor Browser**, it will automatically open the *Tor Status* window (*Figure 2*) before starting the *Tor Browser* (*Figure 3*).

## Connect to the Tor Network - Restricted Access

If you live in an area where accessing the Tor Network directly, as described above, is not possible or risky, you can configure Tor to try and circumvent the obstacles that are in place.

### Step 1

**Navigate** to the *Tor Browser* folder, and then **double click** ![Start Tor Browser.exe](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/010.png)[TorBrowser img 08] to activate the following screen:

![Tor Network Settings](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/012.png)[TorBrowser img 10]

*Figure 4: The Tor Network Settings panel*

### Step 2

**Click** the ![Configure](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/016.png)[TorBrowser img 14] button which will open a new window. You will be asked three short configuration questions to help you access the **Tor Network**.

**Question 1:** *Proxy Access;*  If you need to access the Internet via a proxy check **yes** and then press ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/017.png)[TorBrowser img 15]. If you do not use a proxy check **no** and then press ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/017.png)[TorBrowser img 15].

If you selected **yes** above, fill in your proxy settings on the following screen. If you do not know your proxy settings, check for them in your regular browser.

![Proxy settings](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/018.png)[TorBrowser img 16]

*Figure 5: Proxy settings screen*

**Question 2:** *Restricted Ports;* If you are accessing the Internet through a firewall that only allows access over certain ports, for example *port 80 or 443* for web browsing, select **yes** and press ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/017.png)[TorBrowser img 15] to configure the ports, otherwise select **no** and press ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/017.png)[TorBrowser img 15]. 

![Port restriction configuration](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/019.png)[TorBrowser img 17]

*Figure 6: Port restriction configuration screen*

**Question 3:** *Censored Internet connection*; If you live in a country which is actively blocking or monitoring **Tor** traffic you can configure the **Tor Browser** to use a *Bridge* which will disguise the fact that you are using **Tor**. 

Once you have clicked ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/017.png)[TorBrowser img 15] after *question 2* you will be presented with a screen allowing you to paste in **Bridge addresses**.  See the section [Getting Bridge Addresses](https://securityinabox.org/en/tor_anonymitynetwork#3.3)[Tor Bridge Addresses] for instructions on obtaining bridge addresses.

![Tor Bridge configuration](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/020.png)[TorBrowser img 18]

*Figure 7: Tor Bridge configuration screen*

Once you have added the **bridge addresses** click ![Connect](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/021.png)[TorBrowser img 19] to finish your configuration and connect to the **Tor Network**.

![Tor Status windows - connection progress](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/014.png)[TorBrowser img 12]

*Figure 8: The Tor Status windows, showing the connection progress*

A few moments later, the **Tor Browser** will activate a new browser window displaying the following screen:

![Tor Browser; successfully connected to the Tor network](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/015.png)[TorBrowser img 13]

*Figure 9: Tor Browser; successfully connected to the Tor network*

You can now browse the web with the protection of the *Tor network*.

**Note**: Every time you launch the **Tor Browser**, it will automatically open the *Tor Status* window (*Figure 8*) before starting the *Tor Browser* (*Figure 9*).

## Reconfigure access to the Tor Network

At any stage, if you need to access the **Tor Network** a different way, for example if you have travelled to a country that blocks Tor, you can update your settings from within the browser. Click on the ![Tor icon](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/022.png)[TorBrowser img 20] icon and select *Open Network Settings*.

![Tor Browser options](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/023.png)[TorBrowser img 21]

*Figure 10: Tor Browser options*

You will be presented with a new window (*Figure 11*) that will allow you to change how the **Tor Browser** accesses the Internet. Tick the options you want and change their settings.  Once satisfied with the changes press ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/024.png)[TorBrowser img 22] and restart the **Tor Browser**.

![Tor Browser options](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/025.png)[TorBrowser img 23]

## Getting Bridge Addresses

In order to configure the **Tor Browser** to use **Bridges** you will need to get bridge addresses.  There are two main ways this can be done:

**Email**:

To get bridges by email, you will need either a Gmail or a Yahoo email account.  Send an email to  bridges@bridges.torproject.org with the subject *get bridges*.  After a few minutes you will receive an email with 3 bridges listed and some additional details.

![Email with bridges listed](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/026.png)[TorBrowser img 24]

*Figure 12: Email with bridges listed*

**Web Site**

If your access is not completely restricted you may be able to get **Bridge** addresses from the Tor website by visiting https://bridges.torproject.org/

After opening the website you will need to perform three steps:

- Click on ![Get Bridges](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/027.png)[TorBrowser img 25]

- Click on ![Just Give Me Bridges!](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/028.png)[TorBrowser img 26]

- Fill out the *captcha* and press ![I am human](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/029.png)[TorBrowser img 27]

Once you have entered the *captcha* correctly you will be presented with three **Bridge** addresses.

![Bridge addresses received via the Tor Project website](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/030.png)[TorBrowser img 28]

*Figure 13: Bridge addresses received via the Tor Project website*


**Note**: The *Bridge Database* is designed to prevent anyone from easily learning all of the bridge addresses. At first, it appears to give you the same bridges each time. After a period time, however, it will eventually provide new addresses. 

After you received the bridge addresses copy them to the field in the window as in *Figure 7: Tor Bridge configuration screen* or *Figure 11: Tor Browser options*.
