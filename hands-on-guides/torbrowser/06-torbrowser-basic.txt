# Access the Web Anonymously Using the Tor Browser

The **Tor Browser** is designed to be very easy to use, in fact if you are familiar with using a web browser you will be able to use the **Tor Browser** as it is a version of **Firefox** modified for additional privacy and security. 

**Note:** as the **Tor Browser** is designed with privacy in mind, it is configured not to save any information to your hard drive or USB stick.  This means that when you quit the **Tor Browser** all your browsing history is forgotten.

## Check to Make Sure the Tor Browser is Working

As with any circumvention software it is recommended to perform simple independent tests to ensure the **Tor Browser** works, by going to any website that will try to identify where are you based from the IP address we visit the site from.

There are a number of free website that do this, such as: [check.torproject.org](https://check.torproject.org), [iplocation.net](http://www.iplocation.net/), [ip2location.com](http://www.ip2location.com/), [whatismyipaddress.com](http://whatismyipaddress.com/), etc. If you access these website directly without using **Tor Browser** or other circumvention tool it should display your real IP address and provide a more or less accurate physical location for you. However if you access those websites using **Tor Browser** or other circumvention tool the location and IP address you will see should be different.

## Create a New Identity

You can create a *new identity* for your Browser.  This means that new set of random **Tor** proxy servers will be selected for you to use. This will make you appear to come from a new location to the web servers. To do this, click on ![Tor icon](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/022.png)[TorBrowser img 20] and select *New Identity* from the menu.  The *Tor Browser* will briefly close, clearing your *browsing history* and *cookies* and then restart. Once they browser has restarted you can check your new location as described above in section 4.1.

## Enable the NoScript add-on

**Tor Browser** comes with the **NoScript** add-on pre-installed. **NoScript** can additionally protect you from malicious websites and from leaking your real identity through execution of scripts in your **Tor Browser**, however **NoScript** is disabled by default in **Tor Browser** so this additional protection is not readily available. 

If you wish to enable the extra protections afforded by **NoScript**, it can be turned on by opening the **NoScript** menu and clicking *Forbid Scripts Globally* and then configuring the various *options* it provides. 

We recommend that you read more about [**NoScript** in the **FireFox** chapter](https://securityinabox.org/firefox_noscript)[Firefox Noscript].

## Keep the Tor Browser Up-To-Date

In **[How-to Booklet chapter 1.4](https://securityinabox.org/en/chapter_1_4)[Software up-to-date]** we explain how important is keeping your software up to date, the **Tor Browser** is no exception.  When updates are available, the next time you start the **Tor Browser** you will be presented with a notice that your browser is out of date (*Figure 4*) and instructed to click and choose **Download Tor Browser Update**. You will be brought to the **Tor Project** website where you can get the latest release.  Once downloaded you can follow this guide to install the updated **Tor Browser**.
