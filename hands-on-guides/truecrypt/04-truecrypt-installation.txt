# Install TrueCrypt and Create Standard Volumes

**TrueCrypt** is a program which secures your files by preventing anyone without the correct password from accessing them. It functions like an electronic safe, letting you lock up your files so that only someone with the correct password can open them. **TrueCrypt** works by letting you set up *volumes* or sections on your computer where you can securely store files. When you create data in, or move data to these volumes, **TrueCrypt** will automatically encrypt that information. As you open or take your files out, it automatically decrypts them for use. This process is called *on-the-fly* encryption. 

## Install TrueCrypt

#### Step 1

**Double click** ![installer](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/01.png)[TrueCrypt img 01]; the *Open File - Security Warning* dialog box may appear. If it does, **click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate the  **TrueCrypt** *License* screen.

#### Step 2

## Create a Standard Volume

**TrueCrypt** lets you create two kinds of volumes: *Hidden* and *Standard*. In this section, you will learn how to create a *Standard Volume* in which to store your files. 

To begin using **TrueCrypt** to create a *Standard Volume*, perform the following steps: 

### Step 1

**Double click** ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/52.png)[TrueCrypt img 11] or **Select Start > Programs > TrueCrypt > TrueCrypt** to open **TrueCrypt**.

### Step 2

**Select** a drive from the list in the **TrueCrypt** pane as follows:

![TrueCrypt console](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/12.png)[TrueCrypt img 12]

*Figure 4: The TrueCrypt console*

### Step 3

**Click** ![Create Volume](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/13.png)[TrueCrypt img 13] to activate the *TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard* as follows:

![TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/14.png)[TrueCrypt img 14]

*Figure 5: The TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window* 

There are three options for encrypting a *Standard Volume* in *figure 5*. In this chapter, we will use the *Create an encrypted file container* option. Please refer to the [**TrueCrypt**](http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/) documentation for the description of other two options.

### Step 4

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate the following screen:

![Volume Type window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/15.png)[TrueCrypt img 15]

*Figure 6: The Volume Type window*

The *TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard Volume Type* window lets you specify whether you would prefer to create a *Standard* or *Hidden* **TrueCrypt** volume. 

**Important**: For more information about *How to Create a Hidden Volume*, please refer to the [**Hidden Volumes**](https://securityinabox.org/truecrypt_hiddenvolumes)[Truecrypt Hidden_Volumes] page. 

### Step 5

**Check** the *Standard TrueCrypt Volume* option. 

### Step 6

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate the following screen:

![Volume Creation Wizard - Volume Location pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/16.png)[TrueCrypt img 16]

*Figure 7: The Volume Creation Wizard - Volume Location pane*

You can specify where you would like to store your *Standard Volume* in the *Volume Creation Wizard - Volume Location* screen. This file can be stored like any other file. 

### Step 7

Either **type** in the name of the file into the text field, or **click** ![Select File](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/17.png)[TrueCrypt img 17] to activate the following screen:

![Specify Path and File Name navigation window](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/18.png)[TrueCrypt img 18]

*Figure 8: The Specify Path and File Name navigation window*

**Note**: A **TrueCrypt** Volume is contained inside a normal file. This means that it can be moved, copied or even deleted! You need to remember both the location and name of the file. However, you must choose new file name for the volume you create (also refer to section [**2.3 How to Create a Standard Volume on a USB Memory Stick**](https://securityinabox.org/truecrypt_standardvolumes#2.3)[Truecrypt Standard_Volumes_USB]). In this tutorial, we will create our Standard Volume in the **My Documents** folder, and name the file *My Volume* as shown in *figure 8* above. 

**Tip**: You can use any file name and file extension. For example, you can name your Standard Volume *recipes.doc,* so that it will look like a *Word* document, or *holidays.mpg*, so it will look like a movie file. This is one way you can help disguise the existence of your Standard Volume. 

### Step 8

**Click** ![Save](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/19.png)[TrueCrypt img 19] to close the *Specify Path and File Name* window and return to the *Volume Creation Wizard* window as follows:

![TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard with Volume Location pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/20.png)[TrueCrypt img 20]

*Figure 9: The TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard displaying the Volume Location pane*

### Step 9

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate *figure 10*.

## Create a Standard Volume on a USB Memory Stick

To create a **TrueCrypt** *Standard Volume* on a USB memory stick, perform steps 1 to 7 in section [**2.1 Create a Standard Volume**](https://securityinabox.org/truecrypt_standardvolumes#2.2)[Truecrypt Create_Standard_Volumes], where you activate the *Select a TrueCrypt Volume* screen. Instead of choosing *My Documents* as your file location, **navigate** to and then **choose** your USB memory stick. Then, **enter** a file name and create the *Standard Volume* there. 

## Create a Standard Volume (continued)

At this stage, you are ready to choose a specific encryption method (or *algorithm* as it is referred to on the screen) to encode the data that will be stored in your *Standard Volume*. 

![Volume Creation Wizard Encryption Options pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/21.png)[TrueCrypt img 21]

*Figure 10: The Volume Creation Wizard Encryption Options pane*

**Note**: You may leave the default options here as they appear. All algorithms presented in the two options here are considered secure. 

### Step 10

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate the *TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard* screen as follows:

![Volume Creation Wizard displaying Volume Size pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/22.png)[TrueCrypt img 22]

*Figure 11: The Volume Creation Wizard displaying the Volume Size pane*

The *Volume Size* pane lets you specify the size of the *Standard Volume*. In this example, it is set at 10 megabytes. However, you may specify a different size. Consider the size of the documents and file types you would like to store, and then set an appropriate volume size for them. 

**Tip**: If you would like to backup your Standard Volume to a CD later on, then you should set the size to 700MB or less.

### Step 11

**Type** in your specific volume size into the text field, and then **click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate the following screen:

![TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard featuring Volume Password pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/23.png)[TrueCrypt img 23]

*Figure 12: The TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard featuring the Volume Password pane*

**Important**: Choosing a secure and strong password is among the most important tasks you will perform when creating a *Standard Volume*. A good password will protect your encrypted volume, and the stronger the password you choose, the better. You don't have to create your own passwords, or even remember them, if you use a password generation
program like **KeePass**. Please refer to [**KeePass**](https://securityinabox.org/en/keepass_main)[KeePass Main], to learn more information about password creation and storage.

### Step 12

**Type** your password and then **re-type** your password into the *Confirm* text fields.

**Important**: The *Next* button will remain disabled until passwords in both text fields match. If your password is not particularly safe or secure, you will see a warning advising you of this. Consider changing it! Although **TrueCrypt** will still work with any password you have chosen, your data may not be very secure. 

### Step 13

**Click** ![Next](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/05.png)[TrueCrypt img 02] to activate the following screen:

![TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard featuring Volume Format pane](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/24.png)[TrueCrypt img 24]

*Figure 13: The TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard featuring the Volume Format pane*

**TrueCrypt** is now ready to create a *Standard Volume*. Move your mouse randomly within the *TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard* window for few seconds. The longer you move the mouse, the better the quality of the encryption key.

### Step 14

**Click** ![Format](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/25.png)[TrueCrypt img 25] to begin creating your standard volume.

**TrueCrypt** will now create a file named *My Volume* in the *My Documents* folder as earlier specified. This file will contain a **TrueCrypt** *Standard Volume*, 10 Megabytes in size, that you can use to securely store your files. 

After a *Standard Volume* has been successfully created, the following dialog box will appear: 

![TrueCrypt volume has been successfully created message](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/26.png)[TrueCrypt img 26]

*Figure 14: The TrueCrypt volume has been successfully created message screen*

### Step 15

**Click** ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/27.png)[TrueCrypt img 27] to complete creating your *Standard Volume* and return to the **TrueCrypt** console.

### Step 16

**Click** ![Exit](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/truecrypt-en/28.png)[TrueCrypt img 28] to close *TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard*.
