# Start and stop Orbot

## Step 1

**Touch and hold** the grey **Orbot** icon in the centre of the screen until it turns yellow and says *Orbot is starting*.

*Figures 1 and 2: Activating Orbot*

## Step 2

The first time you start **Orbot** a notification will appear to confirm you connected successfully to the **Tor** network. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-016.png) to see the green **Orbot** indication that **Orbot** is running.

*Figures 3 and 4: Orbot finishes connecting*

**Note:** You will only see the notification screen (Fig. 3) the first time you start **Orbot** after installation.

## Step 3

To disconnect **Orbot** you **touch and hold** the green **Orbot** until it turns grey.  Or if you want to disconnect and quit **Orbot**, **tap** the menu icon (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-019.png)) in the top right of the screen and select ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-020.png) .

*Figures 5: Exiting Orbot*

In order to browse or chat on the internet anonymously, you need to install an app (browser or chat) which can route your communication through a proxy in conjunction with **Orbot**. Please read the related *Hands-on Guides* for using [**Orweb**](/en/Orweb_main) and [**Gibberbot**](/en/gibberbot_main) with **Orbot**.

## Step 4

If at any stage you want to appear to come from a new location, you can get a *new identity* from **Orbot** by **swiping** *left* or *right* on the green **Orbot** image.  The image will briefly spin and then display *You've switched to a new Tor Identity*.

# Configure Orbot to use a Bridge

If **Tor** access is restricted or you wish to disguise the fact that you are using **Tor**, you can configure **Orbot** to use **bridges**.

## Step 1

**Tap** the ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-023.png) icon at the top of the screen to be brought to the settings screen.

## Step 2

Scroll down to the **bridges** section and check the box next to *Use Bridges*.

*Figure 7: Enabling Bridges*

## Step 3

**Tap** the *Bridges* section underneath *Use Bridges* to be presented with a screen to enter the *IP address* of the *bridge* you want to use. Once correctly entered, **tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-025.png). Restart **Orbot** to begin using the *bridge*.

**Note:** to learn more about how to get bridge addresses see the [Tor Hands on Guide](/en/tor_anonymitynetwork#3.3).
