# Create a new password database

In the sections that follow, you will be taught how to create a master password, save your newly-created database, generate a random password for a particular program and create a backup copy of the database.

## Step 1

To open **KeePassDroid** you **tap** the application's icon.

## Step 2

To create a new password database, **tap** *create*.

*Figure 3: Open/create database screen.*

This will activate the *Enter database password* screen as below:

*Figure 4: Enter database password screen.*

## Step 3

In this step you will create a single, unique and strong master password, which you **must** remember, that will be used to lock and unlock your database of passwords.

**Type** in the master password you have invented into the *password* and *confirm password* fields as shown below:

**Tip**: Have a look at [**3. How to create and maintain good passwords**](https://securityinabox.org/chapter_3_1)[Password Select] for more information on how to create a strong master password.

## Step 4

**Tap** **OK** to create and open your Keepass database.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your secure password database. Now you can use it to safely store all your current and future passwords.

**Note**: If you use KeePass on another mobile device or computer, you can copy its database to your device and then open it with **KeePassDroid** or **KeePass**.

# Add a group

**KeePassDroid** stores passwords entries in groups to keep your information organized, the default groups are **Email** and **Internet**, but you can create your own group by **tapping** ![Add Group](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/009.png)[KeyPassDroid img 10], typing the name of the group and then ![OK](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/010.png)[KeyPassDroid img 11].

*Figures 7 and 8: Adding a new group*

**Tap** your newly created group to open it and begin adding password entries.

# Add a password entry

The **Add entry** screen lets you add account information, passwords and other important details into your newly-created database. 

## Step 1

**Tap** ![Add Entry](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/013.png)[KeyPassDroid img 14] to activate the *Add Entry* screen as follows:

*Figures 9: Adding a new password entry*

**Note**: The *Add Entry* screen presents you with a number of fields to be completed. None of these fields are mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience. Filling them in may prove useful in situations where you are searching for a particular entry.

A brief explanation of these different text boxes is presented as follows:

  - **Name**: A name to describe the particular password entry. For example, your *twitter* account.

  - **Username**: The user name associated with the password entry. For example, *TherobotONO*

  - **URL**: The internet site associated with the password entry. For example, *https://twitter.com*

  - **Password**: The password for your account. This section also allows you to [*generate a random password*](https://securityinabox.org/keepassdroid_advanced_use#3.1)[KeyPassDroid Advanced] if you do not want to come up with one your self.

  - **Confirm passwords**: The confirmation of the password.

  - **Comments**: This is where you type in descriptive or general information about the account or site for which you are storing information. For example: Mail server settings: *POP3 SSL, pop.gmail.com, Port 995; SMTP TLS, smtp.gmail.com, Port: 465*

**Note**: Creating or modifying the password entries in **KeePassDroid** does not update your account password! Think of **KeePassDroid** as a secure electronic address book for your passwords. It only stores what you write in it, nothing more.

## Step 2

**Tap** **save** to save your changes.

Your new entry now appears in the group.
