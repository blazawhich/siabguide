# Torbirdy - adding digital anonymity and circumvention to Thunderbird

**TorBirdy** is an Add-on for Thunderbird that can be used to send and receive emails via the Tor network, thus protect your communication with the email server you use, increase the anonymity of your messages and potentially circumvent censorship. **TorBirdy** is a great addition to **Enigmail and GnuPG** encryption.

You can [download TorBirdy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/) from Mozilla Thunderbird Add-ons server.

The following components are required to be started and configured on your computer to use the TorBirdy:

* Thunderbird (please refer to [Thunderbird with Enigmail and GPG - Secure Email Client](https://securityinabox.org/en/thunderbird_main) chapter);
* Tor Browser (please refer to [Tor Browser - Digital Anonymity and Circumvention](https://securityinabox.org/en/tor_main) chapter).

It should be noted that TorBirdy is still considered in development and testing. There are other alternatives methods available that can be used to protect the communication between Thunderbird and your email server such as VPN or SSH proxy - please refer to chapter 8. How-to Booklet chapter [8. How to remain anonymous and bypass censorship on the Internet](https://securityinabox.org/en/chapter-8)
