# Use ChatSecure

## Step 1

When you open **Gibberbot** and access your account, you can chat with any of your contacts by **tapping** their name.

## Step 2

When the chat is initiated, *Warning: This chat is NOT encrypted* will alert you that your communications are not secure.

## Step 4

If any of your contacts uses an enabled OTR client like Gibberbot, [Pidgin](https://securityinabox.org/glossary#Pidgin)[Glossary #Pidgin] or ChatSecure, the warning sign will change to *This chat is secure but the identities of the participants have NOT been verified* in yellow.

## Step 6

When fingerprints are verified all subsequent chat sessions with this contact will be secured and will show the same green sign. 

**Note:** If you chat with **Gibberbot** and Pidgin or some other secure chat, with the same account, at the same time, some problems might occur due to different fingerprints. Be sure to log out of all other clients before logging in again with Gibberbot.
