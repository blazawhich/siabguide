**Gibberbot** is a free and open source application for Android devices, created by the [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/), that lets you organize and manage your different Instant Messaging (IM) accounts using a single interface. It uses [**Off-the-Record (OTR)**](/en/glossary#OTR) software which ensures authenticated and secure communications between clients including **Gibberbot**, **ChatSecure**, **Jitsi**, and [**Pidgin**](/en/glossary#Pidgin). **Gibberbot** can also add a layer of anonymity and protect your communications from many forms of Internet surveillance by connecting through [**Orbot**](/en/glossary#Orbot), which allows your smartphone's internet traffic to be routed through the [**Tor network**](/en/glossary#Tor).
