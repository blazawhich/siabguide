# Scan your computer with avast!

## Step 1

![Avast img 40](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.057_0.png)[Avast img 40]

1. Click *Scan*
2. Click *Scan for viruses*

## Step 2

![Avast img 41](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.058.png)[Avast img 41]

1. Click the contents of the *Scan* select box to choose which type of scan *avast!* should perform
2. A *Quick scan* will scan the directories on your computer where malware is most likely to be present
3. A *Full system scan* will scan your entire computer. This is slower but more thorough.
4. A *Removable media scan* will only scan removable storage devices—such as USB flash memory sticks and external hard drives—that are currently attached to your computer
5. *Select folder to scan* allows you to scan a particular directory on your computer
6. You can schedule a *Boot-time scan* for the next time you restart your computer. This is the most thorough option, as a boot-time scan might find certain types of malware that other scans are likely to miss.

## Step 3

![Avast img 42](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.058_0.png)[Avast img 42]

1. Select the *Quick scan* option
2. Click *Start*

## Step 4

![Avast img 43](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.059.png)[Avast img 43]

1. The progress dial will track *avast!* as it carries out a *Quick scan* for malware on your computer.
2. If you have a lot of files on your computer, the *Quick scan* might not be particularly quick. If necessary, you can pause the scan by clicking here.

## Step 5 (no malware detected)

![Avast img 44](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.060.png)[Avast img 44]

1. If the scan does not find any malware, you can click the *X* in the upper, right-hand corner to close the *avast!* window.

## Step 6 (malware detected)

![Avast img 45](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.061_0.png)[Avast img 45]

1. If the scan detects malware, *avast!* will ask you how to respond.
2. Click *Show results*

## Step 7 (malware detected)

![Avast img 46](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.062_0.png)[Avast img 46]

* If your scan detects malware, you can usually just click *Apply*, and let *avast!* clean things up.
1. *avast!* will show you the location of the infected file, along with the severity of the malware and its name. 
2. If you want to do something unusual with the infected file, you can click the contents of the *Action* select box and choose an option other than *Fix automatically." (*Fix automatically* is usually the right thing to do, though. It will first try to "repair" the file. Failing that, it will try to quarantine the file in Avast's *Virus chest.* And, if that fails as well, it will simply delete the file.)
3. Click *Apply*

## Step 8 (malware detected)

![Avast img 47](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.063.png)[Avast img 47]

1. If *avast!* was able to deal with the infected file, you will see *Action successful* here.
2. If you you chose the *Fix automatically* action, you will see how *avast!* was able to deal with the infected file here.
3. Click *Close*

## Step 9 (malware detected)

![Avast img 48](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/avast-win-en.064.png)[Avast img 48]

* After you close the *Scan Results* window, *avast!* might suggest that you perform a *boot-time scan*. If possible, you should do so. If you can not restart your computer immediately, you should schedule a *boot-time scan* and restart it as soon as possible.
1. If you have time to carry out an immediate *boot-time scan*, click *Yes* (The scan could take an hour or more.)
2. If you do not have time now, click *No* (but remember to schedule a *boot-time scan* for the next time you restart your computer).
