**avast!** is a full-featured anti-virus program that detects and removes malware and viruses from your computer or mobile device. Although **avast!** is free for non-commercial use on a home or personal computer, your free copy *must* be registered after installation. Otherwise, after 30 days you will no longer be able to receive updates of the virus definitions and the program itself.
