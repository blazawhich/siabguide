# Update avast!

*avast!* runs silently in the background, automatically updating its malware definitions whenever you are connected to the Internet. However, you might want to request a manual update if, for example, you have been without an Internet connection for a while. There are two ways to do this:

1. Using the main *avast!* screen
2. Using the pop-up menu that appears when you right click the *avast!* icon in the *System Tray*. 

We recommend that you avoid disabling automatic updates unless absolutely necessary.

## Step 1
