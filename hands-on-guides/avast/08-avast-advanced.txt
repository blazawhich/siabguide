# Advanced Virus Removal Methods

Sometimes the protection offered by **avast!**, **Comodo Firewall** and **Spybot** is simply not sufficient; despite best efforts, our computer system may become infected by malware and other viruses. In section [**4.1 A Short Guide to Dealing with Virus Outbreaks**](#4.1), a few methods were offered for dealing with persistent malware and viruses. However, there *is* more that can be done to eliminate such threats from your computer.

**Method A: Using Anti-malware Rescue CDs/DVDs or USB**

Some anti-malware software companies also offer a free anti-virus 'rescue' CD/DVD. These can be downloaded in ISO image format (that is, a format that can be easily burned onto a CD or DVD or put on USB memory). 

To begin using these anti-malware rescue CDs/DVDs/USB, perform the following tasks:

1. Download specific rescue ISO (see the list below) and burn the anti-malware rescue program to a CD/DVD or put it on USB.
*You can use free program like [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to burn the image to the disk. Or you can use free program like [Universal USB Installer](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/) to put the image on the USB*
**Note**: It is best to perform this step on some other, not infected computer if you can.

2. Insert the disk to CD/DVD player or connect USB to infected computers, and then restart your computer from this USB or CD/DVD.
*Often you can do this by pressing key F10 or F12 or Esc on your keyboard just after switching on the computer. Pay special attention to the instruction on the screen of your computer while it starts to learn how to do this on your computer. Search in the internet for the instructions on how to start (boot) your computer from USB or CD/DVD. Instructions may differ for each computer*.

3. Once the infected computer starts from the USB/CD/DVD re-connect it to the Internet so that the anti-malware rescue program will be able to update its virus definitions if necessary.
*It may be better to connect to the Internet using cable connection if available*.

4. Begin scanning your computer hard drives to remove infections and malware threats.

The following is a list of anti-virus rescue images available for free:

**Note:** You can use each tool listed above separately to maximise your ability to effectively clean your computer.

**Method B: Re Installing the Microsoft Windows Operating System**

In rare instances, a virus infection can be *so* destructive that the software tools recommended earlier may be rendered useless. In situations like this, we recommend that you perform the following tasks:

***Note**: Before you begin, make sure you have all the appropriate license or serial numbers, and installation copies for the **MS Windows** operating system and other programs you require. This procedure may be time consuming but worth the effort if you can't eliminate malware and virus threats the other way*.

1. Create a backup or copy of all your personal files on the computer.

2. Reinstall the **Microsoft Windows** operating system formatting the entire disk.

3. Update the **Microsoft Windows** operating system after the installation has been completed.

4. Install **avast!** (or your preferred anti-virus program) and update it.

5. Install whatever programs you require. Remember to download the latest versions and all the updates for each program.

	**Note**: Under no circumstances should you connect your backup disk to your computer *before* you have successfully performed these tasks. You might risk infecting your computer again.

6. Connect your backup disk to your computer and scan it thoroughly to detect and eliminate any existing problems. 

7. After you have detected and deleted any problems, you may copy your files from the backup disk to the computer hard drive.
