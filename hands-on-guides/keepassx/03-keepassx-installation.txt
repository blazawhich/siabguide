# Download and verify KeePassX

Given the sensitivity of this software, it is particularly important that you verify the integrity the KeePassX bundle you are about to download. After all, if you end up with a malicious version of KeePassX, it will have the ability to send all of your other passwords to whoever created it!

## Step 1

![KeePassX website](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.001.homepage-en-win.png)

* Go to the [KeePassX website](https://www.keepassx.org)
1. Make sure you are on the secure, *https* version of the Website. Click the link above or enter the full address *https://www.keepassx.org* manually.
2. Click the *Download* link

## Step 2

![download KeePassX](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.002.keepassx-download-en-win.png)

1. Click on the Windows *ZIP bundle* to download KeePassX
2. Select the *Save File* option
3. Click OK
4. After your download begins, click on the [SHA-1 hashsums](https://www.keepassx.org/hashsums-sha1) link under *Verify downloads*

## Step 3

![Download progress](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.004.download-progress-en-win.png)

* Wait for the download to finish

## Step 4

![the SHA-1 checksum](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.005.sha1-en-win.png)

1. Find the *SHA-1 checksum* for the Windows *ZIP bundle* that you just downloaded.
* **To make sure you have the official version of KeePassX, you will have to compare this long code to one that you will generate from the file itself**

## Step 5

![RapidCRC Unicode](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.005.sha-1-app-en-win.png)

* In this example, we use *RapidCRC Unicode* but you can use any tool that genreates *checksums* (also known as a *hashes* or *digests*) from files
1. Click *Open Files*

## Step 6

![Open the KeePassX ZIP Bundle](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.005a-sha1-open-en-win.png)

* In the example below, we assume that you downloaded the KeePassX *ZIP Bundle* to your *Downloads* folder, but it could be anywhere
1. Click on *Downloads*
2. Click on file downloaded file
3. Click *Open*

## Step 7

![Compare checksum](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx.006.sha1-verify-en-win.png)

1. Note the *SHA1* checksum generated by the app.
* Compare this checksum to the one displayed on the [KeePassX Hashsums](https://www.keepassx.org/hashsums-sha1) page shown above. If they match, then you have downloaded the official version of *KeePassX*. If not, delete the downloaded file, check the address of the website, and try again.
* **In order for this *download verification* step to work properly, you must use a secure, *https* connection, *both* to download the tool *and* to lookup the appropriate checksum on the official website.**

# Install KeePassX

KeePassX is a *standalone application*, which means you do not really have to *install* it. You just have to put it somewhere—in a folder on your hard drive, for example, or on a USB flash memory stick—and then remember where it is. If you do keep a copy on your hard drive, you might also want to create an *application shortcut*, so that it's easier to launch.

## Step 1

![Unzip the ZIP Bundle](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.001.open-archive.png)

1. Click *Downloads*
2. Double click the ZIP file you downloaded

## Step 2

![KeePassX folder](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.002.copy-from-archive.png)

1. Right-click the KeePassX folder
2. Click *Copy*

## Step 3

![Paste the folder in a suitable location](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.003.paste-app.png)

* In the example below, we put the KeePassX application folder inside the *Documents* library, but you can put it wherever you like. If you keep it on a USB flash memory stick, you will be able to launch the application using other computers.
1. Click on the *Documents* Library
* Right click in the folder where you want to paste your portable KeePassX application folder
2. Click *Paste*

## Step 4

![KeePassX application folder](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.004.open-app-folder.png)

1. Double click on the KeePassX application folder

## Step 5 (optional)

If you put the KeePassX application folder on your computer (and not, for example, on a USB flash memory stick), then you might want to use one or more of the following tricks to create an application shortcut. This will make it easier to launch KeePassX in the future. Of course, you can always just open up this folder and double click the application, as well.

![create shortcut](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.007.shortcuts.png)

1. Right click on KeePassX and select one or more of the following
2. Click *Pin to Taskbar* to create an application shortcut in the Windows *Taskbar* at the bottom of your screen
3. Click *Pin to Start Menu* to create an application shortcut in the Start Menu, alongside your other Windows applications
4. Click *Send to*, then *Desktop (create shortcut)* to create an application shortcut on your Desktop

## Step 6

![Double click KeePassX application](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.005.launch.png)

1. Double click the KeePassX application

## Step 7

![Security Warning](https://siabnext.ttc.io/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassx-install.006.warning.png)

1. Click *Run*

## Step 8
